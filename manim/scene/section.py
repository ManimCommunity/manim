    Attributes
    ----------
    type
        Can be used by a third party applications to classify different types of sections.
    video
        Path to video file with animations belonging to section relative to sections directory.
        If ``None``, then the section will not be saved.
    name
        Human readable, non-unique name for this section.
    skip_animations
        Skip rendering the animations in this section when ``True``.
    partial_movie_files
        Animations belonging to this section.
