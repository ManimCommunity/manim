    return an array of the same size, which describes the portion of the original Bézier
    curve on the interval [a, b].

    To understand the mathematics behind splitting curves, see split_bezier for an explanation.

    To find the portion of a curve with t between a and b:
    1. Split the curve at t = a and extract its 2nd subcurve.
    2. We cannot evaluate the new subcurve at t = b because its range of values for t is different.
       To find the correct value, we need to transform the interval [a, 1] into [0, 1]
       by first subtracting a to get [0, 1-a] and then dividing by 1-a. Thus, our new
       value must be t = (b - a) / (1 - a). Define u = (b-a) / (1-a).
    3. Split the subcurve at t = u and extract its 1st subcurve.

    The final portion is a linear combination of points and thus the process can be
    summarized as a linear transformation by some matrix in terms of a and b. This matrix
    is given explicitly in the 2nd and 3rd degree cases, which are often used in Manim.

    Parameters
    ----------
    points

    To understand what's going on, let's break this down with an example: a cubic Bézier.

    Let :math:`P_0, P_1, P_2, P_3` be the points needed for the curve :math:`C_0 = [P_0, P_1, P_2, P_3]`.
    Define the 3 linear Béziers :math:`L_0, L_1, L_2` as interpolations of :math:`P_0, P_1, P_2, P_3`:
    :math:`L_0(t) = P_0 + t(P_1 - P_0)`
    :math:`L_1(t) = P_1 + t(P_2 - P_1)`
    :math:`L_2(t) = P_2 + t(P_3 - P_2)`
    Define the 2 quadratic Béziers :math:`Q_0, Q_1` as interpolations of :math:`L_0, L_1, L_2`:
    :math:`Q_0(t) = L_0(t) + t(L_1(t) - L_0(t))`
    :math:`Q_1(t) = L_1(t) + t(L_2(t) - L_1(t))`
    Then :math:`C_0` is the following interpolation of :math:`Q_0` and :math:`Q_1`:
    :math:`C_0(t) = Q_0(t) + t(Q_1(t) - Q_0(t))`

    Evaluating :math:`C_0` at a value :math:`t=s` splits :math:`C_0` into two cubic Béziers :math:`H_0`
    and :math:`H_1`, defined by some of the points we calculated earlier:
    - :math:`H_0 = [P_0, L_0(s), Q_0(s), C_0(s)]`
    - :math:`H_1 = [C_0(s), Q_1(s), L_2(s), P_3]`

    A system of equations must be solved to get the first handles of

    Then H2 (the second handles) can be obtained separately.
    The equations were obtained from:
    http://www.jacos.nl/jacos_html/spline/theory/theory_2.html

    In general, if there are N+1 anchors there will be N Bezier curves

    [1 0 0 1 4]   [H1[4]]   [4*A[4] + 2*A[5]]

    which will be expressed as M @ H1 = d.
    M is almost a tridiagonal matrix, so we could use Thomas' algorithm:
    see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tridiagonal_matrix_algorithm

    However, M has ones at the opposite corners. A solution to this is
    the first decomposition proposed here, with alpha = 1:
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tridiagonal_matrix_algorithm#Variants

    [4 1 0 0 1]   [3 1 0 0 0]   [1 0 0 0 1]
    [1 4 1 0 0]   [1 4 1 0 0]   [0 0 0 0 0]

    [0 0 1 4 1]   [0 0 1 4 1]   [0 0 0 0 0]
    [1 0 0 1 4]   [0 0 0 1 3]   [1 0 0 0 1]

                  [3 1 0 0 0]   [1]
                  [1 4 1 0 0]   [0]
                = [0 1 4 1 0] + [0] @ [1 0 0 0 1]
                  [0 0 1 4 1]   [0]
                  [0 0 0 1 3]   [1]

    We decompose M = N + u @ v.T, where N is a tridiagonal matrix, and u
    and v are N-D vectors such that u[0]=u[N-1]=v[0]=v[N-1] = 1, and
    u[i] = v[i] = 0 for all i in {1, ..., N-2}.

    Thus:
       M @ H1 = d
    => (N + u @ v.T) @ H1 = d

    If we find a vector q such that N @ q = u:
    => (N + N @ q @ v.T) @ H1 = d
    => N @ (I + q @ v.T) @ H1 = d
    => H1 = (I + q @ v.T)⁻¹ @ N⁻¹ @ d

    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherman%E2%80%93Morrison_formula
    (I + q @ v.T)⁻¹ = I - 1/(1 + v.T @ q) * (q @ v.T)

    If we find y = N⁻¹ @ d, or in other words, if we solve for y in N @ y = d:
    => H1 = y - 1/(1 + v.T @ q) * (q @ v.T @ y)

    So we must solve for q and y in N @ q = u and N @ y = d.
    As N is now tridiagonal, we shall use Thomas' algorithm.

    Let a = [a[0], a[1], ..., a[N-2]] be the lower diagonal of N-1 elements,
    such that a[0]=a[1]=...=a[N-2] = 1, so this diagonal is filled with ones;
        b = [b[0], b[1], ..., b[N-2], b[N-1]] the main diagonal of N elements,
    such that b[0]=b[N-1] = 3, and b[1]=b[2]=...=b[N-2] = 4;
    and c = [c[0], c[1], ..., c[N-2]] the upper diagonal of N-1 elements,
    such that c[0]=c[1]=...=c[N-2] = 1: this diagonal is also filled with ones.

    If, according to Thomas' algorithm, we define:
    c'[0] = c[0] / b[0]
    c'[i] = c[i] / (b[i] - a[i-1]*c'[i-1]) = 1/(4-c'[i-1]),  i in [1, ..., N-2]
    u'[0] = u[0] / b[0]
    u'[i] = (u[i] - a[i-1]*u'[i-1]) / (b[i] - a[i-1]*c'[i-1]), i in [1, ..., N-1]
    d'[0] = d[0] / b[0]
    d'[i] = (d[i] - a[i-1]*d'[i-1]) / (b[i] - a[i-1]*c'[i-1]), i in [1, ..., N-1]

    Then:
    c'[0]   = 1/3
    c'[i]   = 1 / (4 - c'[i-1]), if i in {1, ..., N-2}
    u'[0]   = 1/3
    u'[i]   = -u'[i-1] / (4 - c'[i-1])
            = -c'[i]*u'[i-1],                                i in [1, ..., N-2]
    u'[N-1] = (1-u'[N-2]) / (3 - c'[N-2])
    d'[0]   = (4*A[0] + 2*A[1]) / 3
    d'[i]   = (4*A[i] + 2*A[i+1] - d'[i-1]) / (4 - c'[i-1])
            = c'[i] * (4*A[i] + 2*A[i+1] - d'[i-1]),         i in [1, ..., N-2]
    d'[N-1] = (4*A[N-1] + 2*A[N] - d'[N-2]) / (3 - c'[N-2])

    Finally, we can do Backward Substitution to find q and y:
    q[N-1] = u'[N-1]
    q[i]   = u'[i] - c'[i]*q[i+1], for i in [N-2, ..., 0]
    y[N-1] = d'[N-1]
    y[i]   = d'[i] - c'[i]*y[i+1], for i in [N-2, ..., 0]

    With those values, we can calculate H1 = y - 1/(1 + v.T @ q) * (q @ v.T @ y).
    Given that v[0]=v[N-1] = 1, and v[1]=v[2]=...=v[N-2] = 0, its dot products
    with q and y are respectively q[0]+q[N-1] and y[0]+y[N-1]. Thus:
    H1 = y - (y[0]+y[N-1]) / (1+q[0]+q[N-1]) * q

    Once we have H1, we can get H2 (the array of second handles) as follows:
    H2[i]   = 2*A[i+1] - H1[i+1], for i in [0, ..., N-2]
    H2[N-1] = 2*A[0]   - H1[0]

    Because the matrix M (and thus N, u and v) always follows the same pattern,
    we can define a memo list for c' and u' to avoid recalculation. We cannot
    memoize d and y, however, because they are always different vectors. We
    cannot make a memo for q either, but we can calculate it faster because u'
    can be memoized.

) -> tuple[Point3D_Array, Point3D_Array]:
    """Special case of :func:`get_smooth_cubic_bezier_handle_points`,
    when the `anchors` do not form a closed loop.
    
    A system of equations must be solved to get the first handles of
    every Bèzier curve (referred to as `H1`).
    Then `H2` (the second handles) can be obtained separately.
    The equations were obtained from:
    https://www.particleincell.com/2012/bezier-splines/
    http://www.jacos.nl/jacos_html/spline/theory/theory_2.html
    WARNING: the equations in the first webpage have some typos which
    were corrected in the comments.

    In general, if there are :math:`N+1` anchors there will be N Bezier curves
    and thus :math:`N` pairs of handles to find. We must solve the following
    system of equations for the 1st handles (example for :math:`N = 5`):

    [2 1 0 0 0]   [H1[0]]   [  A[0] + 2*A[1]]
    [1 4 1 0 0]   [H1[1]]   [4*A[1] + 2*A[2]]
    [0 1 4 1 0] @ [H1[2]] = [4*A[2] + 2*A[3]]
    [0 0 1 4 1]   [H1[3]]   [4*A[3] + 2*A[4]]
    [0 0 0 2 7]   [H1[4]]   [8*A[4] +   A[5]]

    which will be expressed as `M @ H1 = d`.
    :math:`M` is a tridiagonal matrix, so the system can be solved in :math`O(n)`
    operations. Here we shall use Thomas' algorithm or the tridiagonal matrix
    algorithm. See: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tridiagonal_matrix_algorithm>

    Let `a = [a[0], a[1], ..., a[N-2]]` be the lower diagonal of :math:`N-1` elements,
    such that `a[0]=a[1]=...=a[N-3] = 1`, and `A[N-2] = 2`;
        `b = [b[0], b[1], ..., b[N-2], b[N-1]]` the main diagonal of :math:`N` elements,
    such that `b[0] = 2, b[1]=b[2]=...=b[N-2] = 4`, and `b[N-1] = 7`;
    and `c = [c[0], c[1], ..., c[N-2]]` the upper diagonal of :math:`N-1` elements,
    such that `c[0]=c[1]=...=c[N-2] = 1`: this diagonal is filled with ones.

    If, according to Thomas' algorithm, we define:
    c'[0] = c[0] / b[0]
    c'[i] = c[i] / (b[i] - a[i-1]*c'[i-1]) = 1/(4-c'[i-1]),  i in [1, ..., N-2]
    d'[0] = d[0] / b[0]
    d'[i] = (d[i] - a[i-1]*d'[i-1]) / (b[i] - a[i-1]*c'[i-1]), i in [1, ..., N-1]

    Then:
    c'[0]   = 0.5
    c'[i]   = 1 / (4 - c'[i-1]), if i in {1, ..., N-2}
    d'[0]   = 0.5*A[0] + A[1]
    d'[i]   = (4*A[i] + 2*A[i+1] - d'[i-1]) / (4 - c'[i-1])
            = c'[i] * (4*A[i] + 2*A[i+1] - d'[i-1]),         i in [1, ..., N-2]
    d'[N-1] = (8*A[N-1] + A[N] - 2*d'[N-2]) / (7 - 2*c'[N-2])

    Finally, we can do Backward Substitution to find `H1`:
    H1[N-1] = d'[N-1]
    H1[i]   = d'[i] - c'[i]*H1[i+1], for i in [N-2, ..., 0]

    Once we have `H1`, we can get `H2` (the array of second handles) as follows:
    H2[i]   =   2*A[i+1]     - H1[i+1], for i in [0, ..., N-2]
    H2[N-1] = 0.5*A[N]   + 0.5*H1[N-1]

    As the matrix :math:`M` always follows the same pattern, we can define a memo list
    for :math:`c'` to avoid recalculation. We cannot do the same for :math:`d`, however,
    because it is always a different vector.

    ----------
    point
        The Cartesian Coordinates of the point to check.
    control_points
        The Cartesian Coordinates of the ordered control
        points of the bezier curve on which the point may
