class Animation:
    """An animation.

    Animations have a fixed time span.

    Parameters
    ----------
    mobject
        The mobject to be animated. This is not required for all types of animations.
    lag_ratio
        Defines the delay after which the animation is applied to submobjects. This lag
        is relative to the duration of the animation.

        This does not influence the total
        runtime of the animation. Instead the runtime of individual animations is
        adjusted so that the complete animation has the defined run time.

    run_time
        The duration of the animation in seconds.
    rate_func
        The function defining the animation progress based on the relative runtime (see  :mod:`~.rate_functions`) .

        For example ``rate_func(0.5)`` is the proportion of the animation that is done
        after half of the animations run time.
    name
        The name of the animation. This gets displayed while rendering the animation.
        Defaults to <class-name>(<Mobject-name>).
    remover
        Whether the given mobject should be removed from the scene after this animation.
    suspend_mobject_updating
        Whether updaters of the mobject should be suspended during the animation.


    .. NOTE::

        In the current implementation of this class, the specified rate function is applied
        within :meth:`.Animation.interpolate_mobject` call as part of the call to
        :meth:`.Animation.interpolate_submobject`. For subclasses of :class:`.Animation`
        that are implemented by overriding :meth:`interpolate_mobject`, the rate function
        has to be applied manually (e.g., by passing ``self.rate_func(alpha)`` instead
        of just ``alpha``).
