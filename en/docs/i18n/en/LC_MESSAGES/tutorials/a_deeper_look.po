msgid "Let's dissect what just happened step by step.  First, this command executes manim on the file ``scene.py``, which contains our animation code.  Further, this command tells manim exactly which ``Scene`` is to be rendered, in this case, it is ``SquareToCircle``.  This is necessary because a single scene file may contain more than one scene.  Next, the flag `-p` tells manim to play the scene once it's rendered, and the `-ql` flag tells manim to render the scene in low quality."

The additional folders ``media/videos/scene/480p15/partial_movie_files`` as well as ``media/text`` and ``media/Tex`` contain files that are used by manim internally."
