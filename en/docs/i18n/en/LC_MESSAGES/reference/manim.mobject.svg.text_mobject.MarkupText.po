msgid "If your text contains ligatures, the :class:`MarkupText` class may incorrectly determine the first and last letter when creating the gradient. This is due to the fact that ``fl`` are two separate characters, but might be set as one single glyph - a ligature.

If you must use ligatures, the ``gradient`` tag supports an optional attribute ``offset`` which can be used to compensate for that error."
