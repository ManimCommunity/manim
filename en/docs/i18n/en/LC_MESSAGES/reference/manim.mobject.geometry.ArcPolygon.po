msgid "This version tries to stick close to the way :class:`Polygon` is used. Points can be passed to it directly which are used to generate the according arcs (using :class:`ArcBetweenPoints`). An angle or radius can be passed to it to use across all arcs, but to configure arcs individually an ``arc_config`` list has to be passed with the syntax explained below."
