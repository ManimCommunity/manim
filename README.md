Manim is an animation engine for explanatory math videos. It's used to create precise animations programmatically, as seen in the videos at [3Blue1Brown](https://www.3blue1brown.com/).

> NOTE: This repository is maintained by the Manim Community, and is not associated with Grant Sanderson or 3Blue1Brown in any way (though we are definitely indebted to him for providing his work to the world). If you want to study how Grant makes his videos, head over to the main repository (3b1b/manim). This is a more frequently updated repository than the main one, and is recommended if you want to use Manim for your own projects.

### Mac

Before installing `manim-community`, there are some additional dependencies that you must have installed:
 - Homebrew
 - Cairo
 - FFmpeg
 - Sox (optional, for sound)
 - LaTeX (optional, for LaTeX)

#### Homebrew Installation

Homebrew is a package manager similar to `apt` on linux that allows you to install packages easily.
If it is not installed, please install it with this command:

```
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)" < /dev/null 2> /dev/null
```

#### Cairo Installation
1. Run `brew install cairo`

#### FFmpeg Installation
1. Refer to the section on Brew installation to see how to install `brew`
2. Run `brew install ffmpeg`
3. You can check you did it right by running `ffmpeg -version`

#### SoX Installation
1. Refer to the section on Brew installation to see how to install `brew`
2. Run `brew install sox`
3. You can check you did it right by running `sox`

#### LaTeX Installation
1. Refer to the section on Brew installation to see how to install `brew`
2. Run `brew cask install mactex`
3. You can check you did it right by running `latex`

> Note that MacTeX will require at least 4.5GB of hard disk space and bandwidth.
>
> This is due to the fact that it installs every LaTeX addon package offered by [CTAN](https://ctan.org/). Only a few of these packages are required by Manim.
>
> If you would like a smaller LaTeX install which only contains the packages needed by Manim alone, consider installing BasicTeX and suitable packages with the instructions below. This will require about 1.5 GB of space and bandwidth.

If you have installed MacTeX and are comfortable with it, do not install BasicTeX.

1. Refer to the section on Brew installation to see how to install `brew`
2. Run `brew cask install basictex`
3. Ensure that the TeXLiveManager tool `tlmgr` works, by running `tlmgr --version` in the terminal.
4. Run `sudo tlmgr install standalone preview doublestroke relsize fundus-calligra wasysym physics dvisvgm.x86_64-darwin dvisvgm rsfs wasy cm-super`
4. Ensure that LaTeX works by running `latex` in the Terminal.


### Installing Manim-Community itself

1. Manim-Community runs on Python 3.6+. If you'd like to just use the library, you can install it from PyPI via pip:

```sh
pip3 install manimce
```

2. However, if you'd like to contribute to and/or help develop
`manim-community`, you can clone this branch to your local device. To do
this, first make sure you have `git` installed. Then, clone this repo by
executing either

```sh
git clone git@github.com:ManimCommunity/manim.git
```

or

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim.git
```

depending on whether you want to use HTTPS or SSH. Finally, after having cloned this repo, run the
following:

```sh
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To run your first example Scenes, you can run the following commands:

### For users:

1. Download the `example_scenes/basic.py` file from [GitHub](https://raw.github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/blob/master/example_scenes/basic.py), or place it manually
in your current working directory with
```sh
wget https://raw.github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/master/example_scenes/basic.py
```

2. Run the following command:
```sh
manim example_scenes/basic.py SquareToCircle -pl
```

3. Download the [custom_template.tex](https://raw.github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/blob/master/example_scenes/custom_template.tex) and [customtex.py](https://raw.github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/blob/master/example_scenes/customtex.py) example_scenes files, and run the following command:
```sh
manim customtex.py --tex_template custom_template.tex -pl
```

### For developers:

- Run the following command to install manim:
```sh
pip install -e .
```
- Then run the following command below:
```sh
manim example_scenes/basic.py SquareToCircle -pl
```

![](./readme-assets/command.png)

The `-p` flag in the command above is for previewing, meaning the video file will automatically open when it is done rendering. The `-l` flag is for a faster rendering at a lower quality.

Some other useful flags include:
* `-s` to skip to the end and just show the final frame.
* `-n <number>` to skip ahead to the `n`'th animation of a scene.
* `-f` to show the file in finder (for OSX).

You can also use the `--media_dir <directory-path>` command line parameter to specify where the image and animation files will be written.
