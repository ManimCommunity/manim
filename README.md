Manim is an animation engine for explanatory math videos. It's used to create precise animations programmatically, as seen in the videos at [3Blue1Brown](https://www.3blue1brown.com/).

> NOTE: This repository is maintained by the Manim Community, and is not associated with Grant Sanderson or 3Blue1Brown in any way (though we are definitely indebted to him for providing his work to the world). If you want to study how Grant makes his videos, head over to his repository (3b1b/manim). This is a more frequently updated repository than that one, and is recommended if you want to use Manim for your own projects.

## Installation

Manim has a few dependencies that need to be installed before it. Please visit
the
[documentation](https://manimce.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html)
and follow the instructions according to your operating system.


## Usage

Here is an example manim script:
```python
class SquareToCircle(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        circle = Circle()
        square = Square()
        square.flip(RIGHT)
        square.rotate(-3 * TAU / 8)
        circle.set_fill(PINK, opacity=0.5)

        self.play(ShowCreation(square))
        self.play(Transform(square, circle))
        self.play(FadeOut(square))
```

Save this code in a file called `example.py`.  Now open your terminal in the
folder where you saved the file and execute
```sh
manim example.py SquareToCircle -pl
```

You should see your video player pop up and play a simple scene where a square
is transformed into a circle.  You can find some more simple examples in the
[GitHub
repository](https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/tree/master/example_scenes).
Visit the [official
gallery](https://manimce.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html) for more
advanced examples.


## Command line arguments

The general usage of manim is as follows:

![](./readme-assets/command.png)

The `-p` flag in the command above is for previewing, meaning the video file will automatically open when it is done rendering. The `-l` flag is for a faster rendering at a lower quality.

Some other useful flags include:
* `-s` to skip to the end and just show the final frame.
* `-n <number>` to skip ahead to the `n`'th animation of a scene.
* `-f` show the file in the file browser.

For a thorough list of command line arguments, visit the
[documentation](https://manimce.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/configuration.html).
