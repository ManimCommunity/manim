# Code of Conduct



   > TL;DR Be excellent to each other; we're a community after all. If you run into issues with others in our community, please [contact](https://discord.gg/mMRrZQW) a Manim Community Dev, or Moderator.

## Purpose

The Manim Community includes members of varying skills, languages, personalities, cultural backgrounds, and experiences from around the globe. Through these differences, we continue to grow and collectively improve upon an open-source animation engine. When working in a community, it is important to remember that you are interacting with humans on the other end of your screen. This code of conduct will guide your interactions and keep Manim a positive environment for our developers, users, and fundamentally our growing community.



## Our Community

Members of Manim Community are respectful, open, and considerate. Behaviors that reinforce these values contribute to our positive environment, and include:

- **Being respectful.** Respectful of others, their positions, experiences, viewpoints, skills, commitments, time, and efforts.

- **Being open.** Open to collaboration, whether it's on problems, Pull Requests, issues, or otherwise.

- **Being considerate.** Considerate of their peers -- other Manim users and developers.

- **Focusing on what is best for the community.** We're respectful of the processes set forth in the community, and we work within them.

- **Showing empathy towards other community members.** We're attentive in our communications, whether in person or online, and we're tactful when approaching differing views.

- **Gracefully accepting constructive criticism.** When we disagree, we are courteous in raising our issues.

- **Using welcoming and inclusive language.** We're accepting of all who wish to take part in our activities, fostering an environment where anyone can participate and everyone can make a difference.



## Our Standards

Every member of our community has the right to have their identity respected. Manim Community is dedicated to providing a positive environment for everyone, regardless of age, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, nationality, race, religion (or lack thereof), education, or socioeconomic status.

## Enforcement Procedures

This document summarizes the procedures the Manim Community Code of Conduct team uses to enforce the Code of Conduct.



### Summary of processes

When the team receives a report of a possible Code of Conduct violation, it will:

   1. Acknowledge the receipt of the report.
   1. Evaluate conflicts of interest.
   1. Call a meeting of code of conduct team members without a conflict of interest.
   1. Evaluate the reported incident.
   1. Propose a behavioral modification plan.
   1. Propose consequences for the reported behavior.
   1. Vote on behavioral modification plan and consequences for the reported person.
   1. Contact Manim Community moderators to approve the behavioral modification plan and consequences.
   1. Follow up with the reported person.
   1. Decide further responses.
   1. Follow up with the reporter.


### Acknowledge the report

Reporters should receive an acknowledgment of the receipt of their report within 48 hours.



### Conflict of interest policy

Examples of conflicts of interest include:

   * You have a romantic or platonic relationship with either the reporter or the reported person. It's fine to participate if they are an acquaintance.
   * The reporter or reported person is someone you work closely with. This could be someone on your team or someone who works on the same project as you.
   * The reporter or reported person is a maintainer who regularly reviews your contributions
   * The reporter or reported person is your metamour.
   * The reporter or reported person is your family member
Committee members do not need to state why they have a conflict of interest, only that one exists. Other team members should not ask why the person has a conflict of interest.

Anyone who has a conflict of interest will remove themselves from the discussion of the incident, and recluse themselves from voting on a response to the report.



### Evaluating a report

#### Jurisdiction

   * *Is this a Code of Conduct violation?* Is this behavior on our list of inappropriate behavior? Is it borderline inappropriate behavior? Does it violate our community norms?
   * *Did this occur in a space that is within our Code of Conduct's scope?* If the incident occurred outside the community, but a community member's mental health or physical safety may be negatively impacted if no action is taken, the incident may be in scope. Private conversations in community spaces are also in scope.
#### Impact

   * *Did this incident occur in a private conversation or a public space?* Incidents that all community members can see will have a more negative impact.
   * *Does this behavior negatively impact a marginalized group in our community?* Is the reporter a person from a marginalized group in our community? How is the reporter being negatively impacted by the reported person's behavior? Are members of the marginalized group likely to disengage with the community if no action was taken on this report?
   * *Does this incident involve a community leader?* Community members often look up to community leaders to set the standard of acceptable behavior
#### Risk

   * *Does this incident include sexual harassment?*
   * *Does this pose a safety risk?* Does the behavior put a person's physical safety at risk? Will this incident severely negatively impact someone's mental health?
   * *Is there a risk of this behavior being repeated?* Does the reported person understand why their behavior was inappropriate? Is there an established pattern of behavior from past reports?


Reports which involve higher risk or higher impact may face more severe consequences than reports which involve lower risk or lower impact.



### Propose consequences

What follows are examples of possible consequences to an incident report. This consequences list is not inclusive, and the Manim Community Code of Conduct team reserves the right to take any action it deems necessary.

Possible private responses to an incident include:

   * Nothing, if the behavior was determined to not be a Code of Conduct violation
   * A warning
   * A final warning
   * Temporarily removing the reported person from the community's online space(s)
   * Permanently removing the reported person from the community's online space(s)
   * Publishing an account of the incident


### Team vote

Some team members may have a conflict of interest and may be excluded from discussions of a particular incident report. Excluding those members, decisions on the behavioral modification plans and consequences will be determined by a two-thirds majority vote of the Manim Community Code of Conduct team.



### Moderators approval

Once the team has approved the behavioral modification plans and consequences, they will communicate the recommended response to the Manim Community moderators. The team should not state who reported this incident. They should attempt to anonymize any identifying information from the report.

Moderators are required to respond with whether they accept the recommended response to the report. If they disagree with the recommended response, they should provide a detailed response or additional context as to why they disagree. Moderators are encouraged to respond within a week. 

In cases where the moderators disagree on the suggested resolution for a report, the Manim Community Code of Conduct team may choose to notify the Manim Community Moderators.



### Follow up with the reported person

The Manim Community Code of Conduct team will work with Manim Community moderators to draft a response to the reported person. The response should contain:

   * A description of the person's behavior in neutral language
   * The negative impact of that behavior
   * A concrete behavioral modification plan
   * Any consequences of their behavior
The team should not state who reported this incident. They should attempt to anonymize any identifying information from the report. The reported person should be discouraged from contacting the reporter to discuss the report. If they wish to apologize to the reporter, the team can accept the apology on behalf of the reporter.



### Decide further responses

If the reported person provides additional context, the Manim Community Code of Conduct team may need to re-evaluate the behavioral modification plan and consequences.

### Follow up with the reporter

A person who makes a report should receive a follow-up response stating what action was taken in response to the report. If the team decided no response was needed, they should provide an explanation why it was not a Code of Conduct violation. Reports that are not made in good faith (such as "reverse sexism" or "reverse racism") may receive no response.

The follow-up should be sent no later than one week after the receipt of the report. If deliberation or follow-up with the reported person takes longer than one week, the team should send a status update to the reporter.



### Changes to Code of Conduct

When discussing a change to the Manim Community code of conduct or enforcement procedures, the Manim Community Code of Conduct team will follow this decision-making process:

   * **Brainstorm options.** Team members should discuss any relevant context and brainstorm a set of possible options. It is important to provide constructive feedback without getting side-tracked from the main question.
   * **Vote.** Proposed changes to the code of conduct will be decided by a two-thirds majority of all voting members of the Code of Conduct team. Team members are listed in the charter. Currently active voting members are listed in the following section.
   * **Board Vote.** Once a working draft is in place for the Code of Conduct and procedures, the Code of Conduct team shall provide the Manim Community Moderators with a draft of the changes. The Manim Community Moderators will vote on the changes at a board meeting.


### Current list of voting members
