msgid "Note that MacTeX will require at least 4.5GB of hard disk space. This is due to the fact that it installs every LaTeX addon package offered by `CTAN <https://ctan.org/>`_.  Only a few of these packages are required by Manim.  If you would like a smaller LaTeX install which only contains the packages needed by Manim alone, consider installing BasicTeX with the instructions below. This will require only about 1.5GB of space.  If you have installed MacTeX and are comfortable with it, do not install BasicTeX."
