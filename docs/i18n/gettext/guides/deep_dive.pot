We discuss the :class:`.Mobject` base class, how there are essentially three different types of Mobjects, and then discuss the most important of them, vectorized Mobjects. In particular, we describe the internal point data structure that governs how the mechanism responsible for drawing the vectorized Mobject to the screen sets the corresponding BÃ©zier curves. We conclude the chapter with a tour into :meth:`.Scene.add`, the bookkeeping mechanism controlling which mobjects should be rendered."

We will see that there are three relevant parts in a :meth:`.Scene.play` call; a part in which the passed animations and keyword arguments are processed and prepared, followed by the actual \"render loop\" in which the library steps through a time line and renders frame by frame. The final part does some post-processing to save a short video segment (\"partial movie file\") and cleanup for the next call to :meth:`.Scene.play`. In the end, after all of :meth:`.Scene.construct` has been run, the library combines the partial movie files to one video."
