msgid "Keep in mind that Manim is still a work in progress. Tutorials and documentation are always subject to change. When a developer implements a new feature, they are not forced to respect any translations. This means that parts of the translation might become outdated over time."

#: ../../source/contributing/internationalization.rst:29

#: ../../source/contributing/internationalization.rst:37
msgid "To ensure that our translations are of good quality, we use crowdsourcing and voting to approve good translations and reject bad ones. The current threshold for a translation being accepted is 3 votes; this may change as we gauge the level of activity in the community and the quality of translations."

msgid "To vote on translations, first click on a language you would like to help with, then click the \"translate all\" button. You should then enter the translation editor. Next to the search bar, you will see a funnel-like icon - click it and select the \"Need to Be Voted\" option to see translations that need to be voted on. You can then select a string on the left sidebar, view the translations at the bottom and vote with the + and - icons for good and poor translations respectively."
