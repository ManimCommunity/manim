msgid "Note that we are using a raw string (``r'---'``) instead of a regular string (``'---'``). This is because TeX code uses a lot of special characters - like ``\\`` for example - that have special meaning within a regular python string. An alternative would have been to write ``\\\\`` as in ``Tex('\\\\LaTeX')``."

For this to work, the ctex LaTeX package must be installed on your system. Furthermore, if you are only typesetting Text, you probably do not need :class:`~.Tex` at all, and should use :class:`~.Text` or :class:`~.PangoText` instead."
