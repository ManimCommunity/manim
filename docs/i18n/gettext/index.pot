msgid "Animating technical concepts is traditionally pretty tedious since it can be difficult to make the animations precise enough to convey them accurately. Manim relies on Python's simplicity to generate animations programmatically, making it convenient to specify exactly how each one should run. Take a look at the :doc:`Example Gallery <../examples>` for some inspiration on how to create beautiful images and videos with Manim."
