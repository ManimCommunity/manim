msgid "First, you will use a command line interface to create a ``Scene``, the class through which Manim generates videos. In the ``Scene`` you will animate a circle. Then you will add another ``Scene`` showing a square transforming into a circle. This will be your introduction to Manim's animation ability. Afterwards, you will position multiple mathematical objects (``Mobject``\\s). Finally, you will learn the ``.animate`` syntax, a powerful feature that animates the methods you use to modify ``Mobject``\\s."

When you prepend ``.animate`` to any method call that modifies a ``Mobject``, the method becomes an animation which can be played using ``self.play``. Let's return to ``SquareToCircle`` to see the differences between using methods when creating a ``Mobject``, and animating those method calls with ``.animate``."

msgid "This ``Scene`` illustrates the quirks of ``.animate``. When using ``.animate``, Manim actually takes a ``Mobject``'s starting state and its ending state and interpolates the two. In the ``AnimatedSquareToCircle`` class, you can observe this when the square rotates: the corners of the square appear to contract slightly as they move into the positions required for the first square to transform into the second one."

#: ../../source/tutorials/quickstart.rst:344
msgid "In ``DifferentRotations``, the difference between ``.animate``'s interpretation of rotation and the ``Rotate`` method is far more apparent. The starting and ending states of a ``Mobject`` rotated 180 degrees are the same, so ``.animate`` tries to interpolate two identical objects and the result is the left square. If you find that your own usage of ``.animate`` is causing similar unwanted behavior, consider using conventional animation methods like the right square, which uses ``Rotate``."
