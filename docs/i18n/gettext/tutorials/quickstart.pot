If you get an error message instead, or if do not see a video, or if the video output does not look like this, it is likely that manim has not been installed correctly. Please refer to the :doc:`../installation/troubleshooting` page for more information."

msgid "imports all of the contents of the library.  This is the recommended way of using manim, as usually in a single script you will be using quite a few names from the manim namespace.  In particular, this line includes all of the names used in the script: ``Scene``, ``Circle``, ``PINK`` and ``ShowCreation``."

msgid "Now let's look at the next two lines."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/tutorials/quickstart.rst:101
msgid "Most of the time, the code for scripting an animation with manim will go inside the :meth:`~.Scene.construct` method of a class that derives from :class:`.Scene`.  Inside this method, you will create objects, display them on screen, and animate them."

#: ../../source/tutorials/quickstart.rst:105
msgid "The next two lines create a circle and set its color and opacity."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/tutorials/quickstart.rst:112
msgid "Finally, the last line uses the animation :class:`.ShowCreation` to display the circle on screen."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/tutorials/quickstart.rst:119
msgid "Every animation must be contained within the :meth:`~.Scene.construct` method of a class that derives from :class:`.Scene`.  Other code, for example auxiliary or mathematical functions, may reside outside the class."

msgid "The output should look as follows."

#: ../../source/tutorials/quickstart.rst:171
msgid "This example shows one of the most basic features of manim: the ability to implement complicated and mathematically-intensive animations (such as cleanly interpolating between two geometric shapes) in very few lines of code."

For an extensive review of manim's features, as well as its configuration and other settings, see the other :doc:`../tutorials`.
