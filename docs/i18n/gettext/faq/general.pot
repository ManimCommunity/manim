msgid "Why does Manim say that \"there are no scenes inside that module\"?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/faq/general.md:5
msgid "There are two main reasons why this error appears: if you have edited the file containing your `Scene` class and forgot to save it, or if you have accidentally passed the name of a wrong file to `manim`, this is a likely outcome. Check that you have spelled everything correctly."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/faq/general.md:10
msgid "Otherwise you are likely mixing up Manim versions. See {ref}`this FAQ answer <different-versions>` for an explanation regarding why there are different versions. Under the assumption that you are trying to use the `manim` executable from the terminal to run a scene that has been written for the community version (i.e., there is `from manim import *`, or more specifically `from manim import Scene`)"

msgid "then double check whether you have spelled `construct` correctly. If the method containing your code is not called `construct` (or if you are not calling a different, custom method from `construct`), Manim will not call your method and simply output a black frame."
msgstr ""

msgid "What are the default measurements for Manim's scene?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/faq/general.md:36
msgid "The scene measures 8 units in height and has a default ratio of 16:9, which means that it measures {math}`8 \\cdot 16 / 9 = 14 + 2/9` units in width. The origin is in the center of the scene, which means that, for example, the upper left corner of the scene has coordinates `[-7-1/9, 4, 0]`."

msgid "How do I find out which keyword arguments I can pass when creating a `Mobject`?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/faq/general.md:45
msgid "Let us consider some specific example, like the {class}`.Circle` class. When looking at its documentation page, only two specific keyword arguments are listed (`radius`, and `color`). Besides these concrete arguments, there is also a catchall `**kwargs` argument which captures all other arguments that are passed to `Circle`, and passes them on to the base class of {class}`.Circle`, {class}`.Arc`."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/faq/general.md:51
msgid "The same holds for {class}`.Arc`: some arguments are explicitly documented, and there is again a catchall `**kwargs` argument that passes unprocessed arguments to the next base class -- and so on."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/faq/general.md:55
msgid "The most important keyword arguments relevant to styling your mobjects are the ones that are documented for the base classes {class}`.VMobject` and {class}`.Mobject`."

msgid "Can Manim render a video with transparent background?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/faq/general.md:63
msgid "Yes: simply pass the CLI flag `-t` (or its long form `--transparent`). Note that the default video file format does not support transparency, which is why Manim will output a `.mov` instead of a `.mp4` when rendering with a transparent background. Other movie file formats that support transparency can be obtained by passing `--format=webm` or `--format=gif`."

msgid "I have watched a video where a creator ran command X, but it does not work for me. Why?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/faq/general.md:74
msgid "The video you have been watching is likely outdated. If you want to follow along, you either need to use the same version used in the video, or modify the code (in many cases it is just a method having been renamed etc.) accordingly. Check the video description, in some cases creators point out whether changes need to be applied to the code shown in the video."

msgid "The community maintained version has dropped the use of `CONFIG` dictionaries very early, with {doc}`version v0.2.0 </changelog/0.2.0-changelog>` released in January 2021."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/faq/general.md:100
msgid "Before that, Manim's classes basically processed `CONFIG` dictionaries by mimicking inheritance (to properly process `CONFIG` dictionaries set by parent classes) and then assigning all of the key-value-pairs in the dictionary as attributes of the corresponding object."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/faq/general.md:105
msgid "In situations where there is not much inheritance going on, or for any custom setting, you should set these attributes yourself. For example, for an old-style `Scene` with custom attributes like"
