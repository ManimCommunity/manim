You can also try to use your favorite search engine, if you are lucky you might find a blog post, a question on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/manim), or a post in the [r/manim subreddit](https://reddit.com/r/manim)."

msgid "If this is not the case, please take a moment to properly prepare your question: the better you manage to explain what exactly it is you are struggling with, the more efficient people will be able to help you. Regardless of the platform you choose in the next step, StackOverflow has a good guide on [asking good questions](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask)."

Click the link to join, then pick one of the `#manim-help` channels in the sidebar, and post your question there. If you are comfortable with using Discord, try to search for your problem using the search function of our server; perhaps people have been talking about it before!"

In case you used a very long example, is it possible to construct a more minimal version that has the same (faulty) behavior?"

Please refrain from pinging the role immediately when asking your question for the first time, this is considered impolite."

If you do not receive a quick answer to your question, it may be because nobody knows the answer, or because your question is not clear enough, or it could be that everyone who can help you with your problem is busy doing other things."
