"Essentially, manim puts at your disposal three different concepts that "
"you can orchestrate together in order to produce mathematical animations:"
" the **mathematical object** (or **mobject** for short) the "
"**animation**, and the **scene**.  As we will see in the following "
"sections, each of these three concepts is implemented in manim as a "
"separate class: the :class:`.Mobject`, :class:`.Animation`, and "
":class:`.Scene` classes."

"Mobjects are the basic building block for all manim animations.  Each "
"class that derives from :class:`.Mobject` represents an object that can "
"be displayed on screen.  For example, simple shapes such as "
":class:`.Circle`, :class:`.Arrow`, and :class:`.Rectangle` are all "
"mobjects.  More complicated constructs such as :class:`.Axes`, "
":class:`.FunctionGraph`, or :class:`.BarChart` are mobjects as well."

msgid ""
"If you try to display on screen an instance of :class:`.Mobject`, you "
"will only see an empty frame.  The reason is that the :class:`.Mobject` "
"class is an abstract base class of all other mobjects, i.e. it does not "
"have any pre-determined visual shape that can be displayed on screen.  It"
" is only the skeleton of a thing that *could* be displayed.  Therefore, "
"you will rarely need to use plain instances of :class:`.Mobject`; instead"
" you will most likely create instances of its derived classes.  One of "
"these derived classes is :class:`.VMobject`.  The ``V`` stands for "
"Vectorized Mobject.  In essence, a vmobject is a mobject that uses vector"
" `vector graphics <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_graphics/>`_ to "
"be displayed.  Most of the time, you will be dealing with vmobjects, "
"though we will continue to use the term \"mobject\" to refer to the class"
" of shapes that can be displayed on screen, as it is more general."

"As explained in :doc:`quickstart`, usually all of the code in a manim "
"script is put inside the :meth:`.construct` method of a :class:`.Scene` "
"class. To display a mobject on the screen, call the :meth:`~.Scene.add` "
"method of the containing :class:`.Scene`.  This is the principal way of "
"displaying a mobject on the screen when it is not being animated.  To "
"remove a mobject from the screen, simply call the :meth:`~.Scene.remove` "

msgid ""
"By default, mobjects are placed at the center of coordinates, or "
"*origin*, when they are first created.  They are also given some default "

"The :meth:`.move_to` method uses absolute units (measured relative to the"

"the mobject passed as the first argument).  :meth:`align_to` uses "
"``LEFT`` not as measuring units but as a way to determine the border to "
"use for alignment.  The coordinates of the borders of a mobject are "
"determined using an imaginary bounding box around it."

" the style of the interior.  By default, most mobjects have a fully "

"Put simply, animations are procedures that interpolate between two "
"mobjects. For example, :code:`FadeIn(square)` starts with a fully "
"transparent version of :code:`square` and ends with a fully opaque "
"version, interpolating between them by gradually increasing the opacity."
"  :class:`.FadeOut` works in the opposite way: it interpolates from fully"
" opaque to fully transparent.  As another example, :class:`.Rotate` "
"starts with the mobject passed to it as argument, and ends with the same "
"object but rotated by a certain amount, this time interpolating the "
"mobject's angle instead of its opacity."

":meth:`.ApplyMethod` receives one mandatory argument which is the method "
"of the mobject to animate (e.g. :code:`square.set_fill` or "
":code:`square.shift`), and any number of optional arguments which are "
"then passed to the method call.  For example, "
":code:`ApplyMethod(square.shift, UP)` executes :code:`square.shift(UP)`, "

"The :class:`.Scene` class is the connective tissue of manim.  Every "

"Every animation has to be :meth:`played <.Scene.play>` by a scene, and "
"every time interval where no animation occurs is determined by a call to "
":meth:`~.Scene.wait`.  All of the code of your video must be contained in"
" the :meth:`~.Scene.construct` method of a class that derives from "
":class:`.Scene`.  Finally, a single file may contain multiple "
":class:`.Scene` subclasses in the event that multiple scenes are to be "
"rendered at the same time."
