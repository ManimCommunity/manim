msgid "A frequent source for installation problems is if ``pip3`` does not point to the correct Python installation on your system. To check this, run ``pip3 -V``: for MacOS Intel, the path should start with ``/usr/local``, and for Apple Silicon with ``/opt/homebrew``. If this is not the case, you either forgot to modify your shell profile (``.zprofile``) during the installation of Homebrew, or did not reload your shell (e.g., by opening a new terminal) after doing so. It is also possible that some other software (like Pycharm) changed the ``PATH`` variable – to fix this, make sure that the Homebrew-related lines in your ``.zprofile`` are at the very end of the file."
