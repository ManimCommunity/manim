In mid-2020, a group of developers forked it into what is now the community edition; this is the version documented on this website. In early 2021, Grant merged the shaders branch back into master, making it the default branch in his repository. The old version is still available as the branch ``cairo-backend``."

msgid "We recommend using the community edition for most purposes, as it has been developed to be more stable, better tested, quicker to respond to community contributions, and easier for beginners to use. It also has partial experimental OpenGL support and should have full support shortly (as of April 2021)."

msgid "Manim was originally created by Grant Sanderson as a personal project and for use in his YouTube channel, `3Blue1Brown <https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw>`_. As his channel gained popularity, many grew to like the style of his animations and wanted to use manim for their own projects. However, as manim was only intended for personal use, it was very difficult for other users to install and use it."

msgid "If you are a beginner, it is very important that you only use the documentation for your desired version. Trying to install or learn manim using documentation or guides made for different versions will likely fail and only lead to more confusion. As many tutorials and guides on the internet are outdated, we do not recommend you follow them. You should only read tutorials and documentation for other versions once you are aware of the differences between them and know how to adapt code for your desired version."
