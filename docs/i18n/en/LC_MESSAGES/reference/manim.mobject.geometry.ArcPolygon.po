"This version tries to stick close to the way :class:`Polygon` is used. "
"Points can be passed to it directly which are used to generate the "
"according arcs (using :class:`ArcBetweenPoints`). An angle or radius can "
"be passed to it to use across all arcs, but to configure arcs "
"individually an ``arc_config`` list has to be passed with the syntax "
"explained below."

"Two instances of :class:`ArcPolygon` can be transformed properly into one"
" another as well. Be advised that any arc initialized with ``angle=0`` "
"will actually be a straight line, so if a straight section should "
"seamlessly transform into an arced section or vice versa, initialize the "
"straight section with a negligible angle instead (such as "
"``angle=0.0001``)."
