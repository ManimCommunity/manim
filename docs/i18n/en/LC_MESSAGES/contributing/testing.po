msgid "Graphical unit tests: Because ``manim`` is a graphics library, we test frames. To do so, we create test scenes that render a specific feature. When pytest runs, it compares the result of the test to the control data, either at 6 fps or just the last frame. If it matches, the tests pass. If the test and control data differ, the tests fail. You can use ``--show_diff`` flag with ``pytest`` to visually see the differences."
