Date
: February 20, 2026


## What's Changed
### Breaking Changes 🚨
* Fix `ImageMobject` 3D rotation/flipping and remove resampling algorithms `lanczos` (`antialias`), `box` and `hamming` by {user}`chopan050` in {pr}`4266`
* Fix `YELLOW_C` and add `PURE_CYAN`, `PURE_MAGENTA` and `PURE_YELLOW` by {user}`chopan050` in {pr}`4562`

### Highlights 🌟
* Rewrite MathTex to make it more robust regarding splitting by {user}`henrikmidtiby` in {pr}`4515`

  The MathTex implementation has been updated to make it more robust and fix a number of issues.
  A beneficial side effect is that named groups in svg files can now be accessed through SVGMobject.

* Add new Animation Builder `Mobject.always` by {user}`JasonGrace2282` in {pr}`4594`

  This new feature is a convenience wrapper around `add_updater` that allows adding
  updaters to a mobject in an intuitive and easy-to-read way. Example usage in a scene:
  ```python
  d = Dot()
  s = Square()
  d.always.next_to(s, UP)
  self.add(s, d)
  self.play(s.animate.to_edge(LEFT))
  ```


### New Features ✨
* Add a `seed` config option + `--seed` CLI option for reproducible randomness in rendered scenes by {user}`arnaud-ma` in {pr}`4532`

* Enable `strict=True` for `zip()` where safe  by {user}`Oll-iver` in {pr}`4547`

### Bug Fixes 🐛
* using `color` instead of `fill_color` with MathTeX for node labels by {user}`Schefflera-Arboricola` in {pr}`4501`
* fix: infinite recursion caused by accessing color of a highlighted Ta… by {user}`BHearron` in {pr}`4435`
* Prevent potential `UnboundLocalError` in `PolarPlane` by {user}`RinZ27` in {pr}`4557`
* Fixed division by 0 in `turn_animation_into_updater` by {user}`SoldierSacha` in {pr}`4567`
* Fix TOCTOU Race Conditions when creating directories by {user}`SoldierSacha` in {pr}`4587`
* Resolve more race conditions potentially happening during directory creation by {user}`SoldierSacha` in {pr}`4589`
