Highlights
----------

* `#1677 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/1677>`__: Added a new :class:`~.Table` mobject
   This brings easy-to-use and customizable tables to Manim. Several examples for this new mobject can be found at :mod:`the module documentation page <.mobject.table>` and its subpages.

Deprecated classes and functions
--------------------------------

* `#1848 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/1848>`__: Deprecated parameters for :class:`~.DashedLine` and :class:`~.DashedVMobject`
   - ``dash_spacing`` is an unused parameter
   - ``positive_space_ratio`` has been replaced with the shorter name ``dashed_ratio``

* `#1773 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/1773>`__: Remove all classes and functions that were deprecated until ``v0.7.0`` and ``v0.8.0``
   The classes ``FadeInFrom``, ``FadeOutAndShift``, ``FadeOutToPoint``, ``FadeInFromPoint``, ``FadeInFromLarge``, ``VFadeIn``, ``VFadeOut``, ``VFadeInThenOut`` have been removed, use :class:`~.FadeIn` or :class:`~.FadeOut` with appropriate
   keyword arguments instead.

   The classes ``CircleIndicate``, ``ShowCreationThenDestruction``, ``AnimationOnSurroundingRectangle``, ``ShowPassingFlashAround``, ``ShowCreationThenDestructionAround``, ``ShowCreationThenFadeAround``, ``WiggleOutThenIn``, ``TurnInsideOut`` have been removed. Use :class:`~.Circumscribe`, :class:`~.ShowPassingFlash`, or :class:`~.Wiggle` instead.

   The classes ``OpenGLTexMobject`` and ``OpenGLTextMobject`` have been removed, use :class:`~.MathTex` and :class:`~.Tex` instead. Also, ``VMobjectFromSVGPathstring`` has been removed, use :class:`~.SVGPathMobject` instead.

   Finally, the utility functions ``get_norm`` and ``cross`` have been removed (use the corresponding Numpy methods instead), and the function ``angle_between`` has been replaced with ``angle_between_vectors``.

* `#1731 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/1731>`__: Deprecated :class:`~.ParametricSurface` parameters
   - ``u_min`` and ``u_max`` have been replaced by ``u_range``.
   - ``v_min`` and ``v_max`` have been replaced by ``v_range``.

   - Added :meth:`.NumberLine.add_labels` method to :class:`~.NumberLine` which accepts a dictionary of positions/values.
   - :meth:`.CoordinateSystem.add_coordinates` now accepts a dictionary too.

* `#1719 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/1719>`__: Added a :class:`~.Broadcast` animation
