Pull requests merged
====================

A total of 53 pull requests were merged for this release.

Highlight
---------

* `#1075 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/1075>`__: Add OpenGL Renderer
   Adds an OpenGLRenderer, OpenGLCamera, OpenGL-enabled Mobjects, and a `--use_opengl_renderer` flag. When this flag is passed, you can pass the `-p` flag to preview animations, the `-w` flag to generate video, and the `-q` flag to specify render quality. If you don't pass either the `-p` or the `-w` flag, nothing will happen. Scenes rendered with the OpenGL renderer must *only* use OpenGL-enabled Mobjects.
New feature
-----------

* `#1037 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/1037>`__: Added new fade and transform animations (:class:`~.TransformMatchingShapes`, :class:`~.TransformMatchingTex`, :class:`~.FadeTransform`) from 3b1b/manim
   Added new Fade animation: :class:`~FadeOutToPoint`
   Added :class:`~FadeTransform` and :class:`~FadeTransformPieces` for transforming mobjects and submobjects with a fade
   Added :class:`~TransformMatchingShapes` and :class:`~TransformMatchingTex` for transforming mobjects and tex that have matching parts
* `#1097 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/1097>`__: Added 3D Mobject :class:`~.Dot3D`

* `#1074 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/1074>`__: Added jupyter media_width option to the config

* `#1107 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/1107>`__: Added :class:`~.Unwrite` animation class to complement :class:`~.Write`
   Added :class:`Unwrite` which inherits from :class:`~.Write`. It automatically reverses the animation of :class:`~.Write` by passing the reversed rate function, but it also takes an additional boolean parameter `reverse` which, if `False`, renders the animation from left to right (assuming text oriented in the usual way), but if `True`, it renders right to left.
* `#1085 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/1085>`__: Added :class:`~.Angle` and :class:`~.RightAngle` for intersecting lines
   :class:`~.Angle` and :class:`~.RightAngle` both take two lines as input. If they intersect, or share a common vertex, an angle is drawn between them. Users can customize the look of the angle and also use a dotted right angle.
Enhancement
-----------

* `#1144 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/1144>`__: Improved quality of GIFs

* `#1157 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/1157>`__: Refresh triangulation on call to :meth:`~.OpenGLVMobject.apply_points_function`
   Rotate called apply_points_function, which was previous not subclassed by OpenGLMobject - now it is. Then, the vertex normals can be updated too.

   Additionally, the old_points matrix would change after rotating, making the old points / new points test irrelevant. This is addressed with a .copy call.
* `#1151 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/1151>`__: Added parametric function support to :class:`OpenGLSurface`

* `#1139 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/1139>`__: In-Code `config["preview"]` Support

* `#1123 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/1123>`__: Added caching, skipping, and user-specified background colors to the OpenGL renderer
   OpenGL play logic has been improved to support caching and skipping with `-n` argument ( it is now similar to Cairo play logic). A random bug was fixed in OpenGLSurface and OpenGL background color can now be changed via `background_color` argument.
* `#1118 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/1118>`__: Allow passing animation arguments with .animate syntax
   Users will now be able to do things like `obj.animate(run_time=2).method(arg)` if they want to specify animation arguments for an individual `.animate` call, and can still not specify any arguments like `obj.animate.method(arg)`.

   Passing animation arguments is only allowed directly after `.animate` is accessed, if passed elsewhere then a `ValueError` is raised.
* `#718 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/718>`__: Rotating the numbers in y axis
   In Axes, the y axis will be rotated 90deg but the numbers are
   also rotated and shouldn't be. Fixes this issue.
* `#1070 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/1070>`__: Raise FileNotFoundError when unable to locate the .cfg file specified via `--config_file`
   Raising the error will stop script execution and let the user know that there are problems with the `--config_file` location instead of reverting back to the default configuration.
Bug
---

* `#1193 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/1193>`__: Fixed using :class:`Animation`s without a child :class:`~.Mobject` in :class:`~.AnimationGroup`
   `AnimationGroup` may now take `Animation` objects which do not have a child `Mobject`, such as `Wait`.
* `#1170 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/1170>`__: Fixed minor SVG parsing bugs

* `#1159 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/1159>`__: Added support for multiple transforms in the same SVG element

* `#1156 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/1156>`__: Fixed :class:`~.DrawBorderThenFill` to support OpenGL and improved type hints for some functions
   Fixed a bug in :class:`~.DrawBorderThenFill` that prevented :class:`~.Write` animations from working with :class:`~.OpenGLVMobjects` and slightly improved type hints for some animation functions to include :class:`~.OpenGLVMobject`.
* `#1134 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/1134>`__: Fixed the `-a` flag.
   The `-a`/`--write-all` flag was broken. When used, it would cause Manim to crash just after beginning to render the second scene.
* `#1115 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/1115>`__: Fixed bugs in :class:`~.OpenGLMobject` and added :class:`ApplyMethod` support 
   Fixed undefined variables and converted :class:`Mobject` to :class:`OpenGLMobject`. Also, fixed assert statement in :class:`ApplyMethod`.
* `#1092 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/1092>`__: Refactored coordinate_systems.py, fixed bugs, added :class:`~.NumberPlane` test
   The default behavior of :meth:`~.Mobject.rotate` is to rotate about the center of :class:`~.Mobject`. :class:`~.NumberLine` is symmetric about the point at the number 0 only when ``|x_min|`` == ``|x_max|``. Ideally, the rotation should coincide with
   the point at number 0 on the line.

   Added a regression test and additionally fixed some bugs introduced in :pr:`718`.
* `#1078 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/1078>`__: Removed stray print statements from `__main__.py`
   Uses rich's print traceback instead and fixes an issue in printing the version twice when `manim --version` is called.
* `#1086 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/1086>`__: Fixed broken line spacing in :class:`~.Text`
   The `line_spacing` kwarg was missing when creating :class:`Text` Mobjects; this adds it.
* `#1083 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/1083>`__: Corrected the shape of :class:`~.Torus`
   :class:`Torus` draws a surface with an elliptical cross-section when `minor_radius` is different from 1. This PR ensures the cross-section is always a circle.
Deprecation
-----------

* `#1124 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/1124>`__: Deprecated :class:`ShowCreation` in favor of :class:`Create`
   1. Deprecated :class:`ShowCreation` in favor of :class:`Create` across the library with the exception of the `show_creation` boolean variable `vector_space_scene.py`
   2. Added a deprecation warning in the original :class:`ShowCreation` class.
* `#1110 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/1110>`__: Deprecated SmallDot + OpenGLSmallDot
   `SmallDot` isn't necessary and a deprecation warning will be raised. This will be removed in a future release.

   Updated `coords_to_point` and `point_to_coords` under `manim/scene/graph_scene.py` as the dosctring of each function confusingly described the opposite of what it is supposed to do.
Release
-------

* `#1073 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/1073>`__: Removed "one line summary" from PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md

Testing
-------

* `#1160 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/1160>`__: Enable CI testing for OpenGL

* `#1100 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/1100>`__: Rewrote test cases to use sys.executable in the command instead of "python"
   Tests would fail due to `capture()` not spawning a subshell in the correct environment, so when python was called, the test would be unable to find necessary packages.
* `#1079 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/1079>`__: Removed the hardcoded value, `manim`, in `test_version.py`

Infrastructure
--------------

* `#1187 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/1187>`__: Add CodeCov to Github Workflow

* `#1166 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/1166>`__: CI: Use poetry's cache dir rather than pip

* `#1071 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/1071>`__: Enable pytest-cov based code coverage
   - Include pytest-cov as a python module as part of developer dependencies
   - In updating poetry to include pytest-cov, manimpango moved from version 0.2.3 to 0.2.4, and libpango1.0-dev needed to be installed in Ubuntu.
   - Add to the CI workflow (`ci.yml`) to create and upload test coverage.
Maintenance
-----------

* `#1167 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/1167>`__: Merge :class:`~.OpenGLMobject` and :class:`~.Mobject`

* `#1164 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/1164>`__: Fixed single PEP8 style in `cairo_renderer.py`

* `#1140 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/1140>`__: Flake8 Compat & Code Cleanup

* `#1019 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/1019>`__: Refactored :meth:`~.Scene.play`
   - Removed the _**three**_ decorators of :meth:`~.Scene.play`, in particular: caching logic and file writer logic are now included within :meth:`~.Scene.play` (it wasn't possible before, because `scene.wait` and `scene.play` were two different things).
   - Added `is_static_wait` attributes to Wait. (<=> if wait is a frozen frame). 
   - Renamed and moved `scene.add_static_frame` to `renderer.freeze_current_frame`. 
   - Now when calling play without animation, it raises `ValueError` instead of just a warning.
   - Fixed :pr:`874` by modfying `renderer.update_skipping_status`
   - `renderer` starts the animation with `scene.begin_animations` (`scene.compile_animation_data` used to do this)
   - The run time and the time progression generation is now done in `scene.play_internal` although it'd make more sense that renderer processes it later. 
   - Added a bunch of cool tests thanks to mocks, and thanks to the new syntax `scene.render`
