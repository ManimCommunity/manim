Pull requests merged
====================

A total of 59 pull requests were merged for this release.

Breaking changes
----------------

* `#1843 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/1843>`__: Dropped redundant OpenGL files and add metaclass support for :class:`~.Surface`
   - ``OpenGL<x>`` classes from ``opengl_geometry.py``, ``opengl_text_mobject.py``, ``opengl_tex_mobject.py``, ``opengl_svg_path.py``, ``opengl_svg_mobject.py`` and most of ``opengl_three_dimensions.py`` have been removed.
   - ``ParametricSurface`` has been renamed to :class:`~.Surface`

Deprecated classes and functions
--------------------------------

* `#1941 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/1941>`__: Added examples, tests and improved documentation for :mod:`~.coordinate_systems`


* `#1694 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/1694>`__: Added ``font_size`` parameter for :class:`~.Tex` and :class:`~.Text`, replaced ``scale`` parameters with ``font_size``


* `#1860 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/1860>`__: Removed :class:`~.GraphScene`, :class:`~.NumberLineOld` and parameters for :class:`~.ChangingDecimal`


New features
------------

* `#1929 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/1929>`__: Implementing a ``zoom`` parameter for :meth:`.ThreeDScene.move_camera`
   Zooming into a :class:`~.ThreeDScene` can now be done by calling, for example, ``self.move_camera(zoom=2)`` in the ``construct`` method.

* `#1980 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/1980>`__: Added a ``dissipating_time`` keyword argument to :class:`~.TracedPath` to allow animating a dissipating path


* `#1899 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/1899>`__: Allow switching the renderer to OpenGL at runtime
   Previously, the metaclass approach only changed the inheritance chain to switch between OpenGL and cairo mobjects when the class objects are initialized, i.e., at import time. This PR also triggers the changes to the inheritance chain when the value of ``config.renderer`` is changed.

* `#1828 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/1828>`__: Added configuration option ``zero_pad`` for zero padding PNG file names

* `#1882 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/1882>`__: Added OpenGL support for :class:`~.PMobject` and its subclasses


* `#1881 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/1881>`__: Added methods :meth:`.Angle.get_lines` and :meth:`.Angle.get_value` to :class:`~.Angle`


* `#1952 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/1952>`__: Added the option to save last frame for OpenGL


* `#1922 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/1922>`__: Fixed IPython interface to exit cleanly when OpenGL renderer raises an error

   The OpenGL renderer can now be used in jupyter notebooks when using the ``%%manim`` magic command.

* `#1841 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/1841>`__: Reduced default resolution of :class:`~.Dot3D`


* `#1866 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/1866>`__: Allow passing keyword argument ``corner_radius`` to :class:`~.SurroundingRectangle`


* `#1847 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/1847>`__: Allow :class:`~.Cross` to be created without requiring a mobject
