   - Removed `get_graph`, `get_implicit_curve`, `get_derivative_graph`, `get_line_graph` and `get_parametric_curve` in favour of their `plot` variants
   - Removed `FullScreenFadeRectangle` and `PictureInPictureFrame`
   - Removed `path_arc` parameter from :class:`~.SpinInFromNothing`
   - Removed `set_submobjects` method from `opengl_mobject.py`

Enhancements
------------

* `#2383 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/2383>`__: Made :meth:`.Surface.set_fill_by_value` support gradients along different axes
   This pull request allows users to set a color gradient by value on different axes.

* `#2388 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/2388>`__: Added ``about_point`` keyword argument to :class:`~.ApplyMatrix`
   :class:`~ApplyMatrix` now has optional kwarg `about_point` in its `__init__` method.

* `#2395 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/2395>`__: Add documentation for paths functions
   * Added documentation and typings for paths functions.
   * Moved `paths_along_circles` to a separate function and made it more general.

* `#2372 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/2372>`__: Improved DashedVMobject
   DashedVMobject used to create stretched and uneven dashes on most plotted curves. Now the dash lengths are equalized. An option is reserved to use the old method.
   New feature added to DashedVMobject: dash_offset. This parameter shifts the starting point. It can be used with ValueTracker and what not to create [cool looping animations](https://imgur.com/2cK6eu4).

Fixed bugs
----------

* `#2392 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/2392>`__: Fixed ``ZeroDivisionError`` in :mod:`~.mobject.three_dimensions`
   manim/mobject/three_dimensions.py

Documentation-related changes
-----------------------------

* `#2352 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/2352>`__: docs: add localized with Crowdin badge


* `#2371 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/2371>`__: Add 'dvips' to list of required LaTeX packages on Linux

* `#2368 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/2368>`__: Added note in Internationalization


Code quality improvements and similar refactors
-----------------------------------------------

* `#2410 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/2410>`__: Fixed Flake8


* `#2401 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/2401>`__: Fixed type annotations in :mod:`.mobject.three_dimensions`


* `#2405 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/2405>`__: Removed unused OpenGL files
   removes `opengl_tex_mobject.py` and `opengl_text_mobject.py` as mentioned in #2400

* `#2399 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/2399>`__: Fixed type annotations in :mod:`~.mobject.table`

Unclassified changes
--------------------

* `#2397 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/2397>`__: Add `label_constructor` parameter for :class:`~NumberLine`.
   - Allows changing the class that will be used to construct :class:`~.Axes` and :class:`~.NumberLine` labels by default.
       - Now it possible to easily use :class:`~.Text` for labels if needed.

* `#2362 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/2362>`__: Fixed phi updater in :meth:`.ThreeDScene.begin_3dillusion_camera_rotation`
   The phi updater in the `begin_3dillusion_camera_rotation` method uses a cosinus value, which is not equal to 0 when `dt` = 0, thus creating a small bump at the beginning of the rotation.
   Also added typings, and removed the defaults phi and theta values so that the method can be used without passing the current camera position as arguments.

* `#2377 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/2377>`__: Fixed type hint for an argument of :class:`~.MoveAlongPath`
