Pull requests merged
====================

A total of 29 pull requests were merged for this release.

Deprecated classes and functions
--------------------------------

* `#2390 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/2390>`__: Removed deprecations up to `v0.13.0`
   - Removed ``get_graph``, ``get_implicit_curve``, ``get_derivative_graph``, ``get_line_graph`` and ``get_parametric_curve`` in favour of their ``plot`` variants
   - Removed ``FullScreenFadeRectangle`` and ``PictureInPictureFrame``
   - Removed ``path_arc`` parameter from :class:`~.SpinInFromNothing`
   - Removed ``set_submobjects`` method from ``opengl_mobject.py``

New features
------------

* `#2341 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/2341>`__: Update :class:`~.Text` to use new ``ManimPango`` color setting
   * :class:`~.Text` class now uses color setting introduced in ``ManimPango 0.4.0`` for color and gradient.

* `#2397 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/2397>`__: Added ``label_constructor`` parameter for :class:`~.NumberLine`
   Allows changing the class that will be used to construct :class:`~.Axes` and :class:`~.NumberLine` labels by default. Makes it possible to easily use :class:`~.Text` for labels if needed.

Enhancements
------------

* `#2383 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/2383>`__: Made :meth:`.Surface.set_fill_by_value` support gradients along different axes


* `#2388 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/2388>`__: Added ``about_point`` keyword argument to :class:`~.ApplyMatrix`


* `#2395 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/2395>`__: Add documentation for paths functions


* `#2372 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/2372>`__: Improved :class:`~.DashedVMobject`
   :class:`~.DashedVMobject` used to create stretched and uneven dashes on most plotted curves. Now the dash lengths are equalized. An option is reserved to use the old method.
   New keyword argument: ``dash_offset``. This parameter shifts the starting point.

Fixed bugs
----------

* `#2409 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/2409>`__: Fixed performance degradation by trimming empty curves from paths when calling :meth:`.VMobject.align_points`
