Pull requests merged
====================

A total of 58 pull requests were merged for this release.

Breaking changes
----------------

* :pr:`3020`: Adding :class: ManimColor to manim and converting all types


Highlights
----------

* :pr:`3299`: Added new ``manim checkhealth`` CLI subcommand
   This adds a new command line interface subcommand which can be used to check whether a local installation of Manim has been configured correctly, and all required (and optional) dependencies are available. To try it, run it via ``manim checkhealth`` or ``python -m manim checkhealth``.

New features
------------

* :pr:`3361`: Added three new rate functions
    This adds the rate functions :func:`.smoothstep`, :func:`.smootherstep`,
    :func:`.smoothererstep` based on the SmoothStep sigmoid functions.

* :pr:`3264`: Added new mobjects :class:`.LabeledLine` and :class:`.LabeledArrow`

Enhancements
------------

* :pr:`3190`: Made :class:`.CurvesAsSubmobjects` mobjects compatible with :meth:`.input_to_graph_point`


Fixed bugs
----------

* :pr:`3205`: Fixed type hint of ``angle`` in :class:`.Arc`


* :pr:`3210`: Fixed :class:`.DecimalNumber` with ``show_ellipsis=True`` with the OpenGL renderer


* :pr:`3211`: Fixed display issues with custom labels for :class:`.Axes` with the OpenGL renderer


* :pr:`3298`: Fixed expand animation for :class:`.ManimBanner`


* :pr:`3306`: Fixed IPython terminal history and embedded shell instantiation for scenes using :meth:`.Scene.interactive_embed`


* :pr:`3315`: Fixed issue with parameter types in :meth:`.Scene.add_subcaption`


* :pr:`3423`: Fixed incorrect submobject count of multi-part :class:`.Tex` mobjects
   This resolves various issues where formulas were not displayed completely,
   like it was the case with ``MathTex("1", "^{", "0")``.


Documentation-related changes
-----------------------------

* :pr:`3219`: Enable social cards for links to documentation


* :pr:`3274`: Replaced incorrect mentions of Python 3.7 as the minimally required version


* :pr:`3297`: Improved arrow tip sowcase example for :class:`.ArrowTip`


* :pr:`3312`: Added documentation for :func:`.always_redraw`


Changes concerning the testing system
-------------------------------------

* :pr:`3416`: Fix tests to run on Cairo 1.18.0


Code quality improvements and similar refactors
-----------------------------------------------

* :pr:`3086`: Introduced a new module :mod:`.typing` for type hints
   This also adds various type hints to integral parts of the code base.


* :pr:`3226`: Avoid using a mobject as a default argument of :class:`.ArcBrace`


* :pr:`3229`: Made docbuild errors easier to debug + fixed error from changed exception class


* :pr:`3231`: Fixed errors reported by ``flake8``


* :pr:`3232`: Upgrade ReadTheDocs build environment to use newer image


* :pr:`3286`: Optimized :meth:`.Axes.coords_to_point`
   As the title says, I optimized `Axes.coords_to_point`. Best results if combined with PR [#3285: Optimized :meth:`NumberLine.number_to_point`](https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/3285).

New releases
------------

* :pr:`3198`: Prepare new release: v0.17.3


Unclassified changes
--------------------

* :pr:`3218`: Small grammar change to deep_dive doc


* :pr:`3224`: Replace last `os.path` occurrencies by `pathlib`


* :pr:`3236`: Minor fix, return self


* :pr:`3251`: Add LaTeX installation instructions for Fedora


* :pr:`3253`: Bump tornado from 6.3.1 to 6.3.2


* :pr:`3257`: CI: fix a config error from poetry


* :pr:`3272`: Bump docker/build-push-action from 3 to 4


* :pr:`3282`: fix: prevent vector position array from being modified (#3273)


* :pr:`3284`: fixed the use of the LinearTransformationSceneExample in Jupyter notebooks


* :pr:`3287`: Bump cryptography from 41.0.1 to 41.0.2


* :pr:`3290`: Update dependencies for apple silicon in macos.rst
   Adds `pkg-config` to the list of needed dependencies for apple silicon.
   According to https://pypi.org/project/ManimPango/ manim-pango needs pkg-config

* :pr:`3302`: fix: changed minor typo in OpenGLVMobject


* :pr:`3322`: Added ability to remove non-svg LaTeX files
   * Made manim auto-remove non-tex and non-svg files by default. This behavior can be prevented with the CLI flag `--no_latex_cleanup`
   * Made manim check if an svg for a TeX expression already exists BEFORE creating `.aux`, `.dvi`, and other files.
     * This makes sure that even the user already has the svg for an expression and runs their code with `--no_latex_cleanup`, they will not get cluttered with the `.aux`, `.dvi`, and other files for that expression.

* :pr:`3325`: Added docs for functions in `mobject_update_utils`
   * Added docstrings for:
     * :meth:`always_rotate`
     * :meth:`always_shift`
     * :meth:`turn_animation_into_updater`
   * Added typehints to above functions

* :pr:`3340`: fix: issue with ImageMobject bounding box


* :pr:`3343`: fix: return value of TexTemplate.add_to...


* :pr:`3350`: Added missing dependency ``typing-extensions``


* :pr:`3353`: Added docstring to Mobject.center


* :pr:`3355`: rtd: enable htmlzip build


* :pr:`3366`: feat: DecimalNumber() - added spacing between values and unit
   - added the parameter `unit_buff_per_font_unit` to add additional space between the numeric values and the unit
   - default value `unit_buff_per_font_unit=0` ensures backward compatibility
   - also added parameter documentation in docstring

* :pr:`3377`: fix a typo in deep_dive.rst
   Fix a simple typo

* :pr:`3389`: fix(docs): Remove extra curly bracket in LaTeX math expression


* :pr:`3392`: Bug fix: Use np.isclose for float equality in number line elongated ticks
   Resolves #3394 by using `np.isclose` to check for float equality instead of using default float equality, which sometimes is not one might expect (see `0.1 + 0.2 != 0.3` for example).

* :pr:`3395`: chore(deps): add Python 3.12 support
   Currently, Manim can only be installed on Python 3.11 and below. As Python 3.12 just came out, I think it is good time to update a bit Python requirements so that newer Python versions can install Manim.

   I updated the dependencies, and test workflows.

* :pr:`3397`: Several GitHub actions updates


* :pr:`3399`: Updated several dependencies


* :pr:`3404`: Fix: Fixed a bug in regards to empty inputs in AddTextLetterByLetter class.


* :pr:`3405`: pyproject.toml: update manimpango version


* :pr:`3417`: Introduce new workflow creating a downloadable version of the documentation


* :pr:`3419`: CI: fix caching of cairo
