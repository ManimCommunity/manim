Breaking changes
----------------

* `#1347 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/1347>`__: Restructure vector_field module and add documentation
   `VectorField` is renamed to `ArrowVectorField` and a new class `VectorField` is added as a superclass for `ArrowVectorField` and `StreamLines`. Also the class `AnimatedStreamLines` is removed. It's functionality is moved to `StreamLines`. Added a lot of new options when working with vector fields. `ShowPassingFlashWithThinningStrokeWidth` was moved to the indication module.

* `#1161 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/1161>`__: Upgrades to CoordinateSystem and graphing.
   Breaking changes were introduced to :class:`Axes`, :class:`ThreeDAxes`, :class:`NumberPlane` and :class:`NumberLine`
   All the above now use lists to construct their ranges as opposed to explicitly defining these values --> `x_range`  :  `[x_min, x_max, x_step]`. There were also many upgrades to these classes which improves their functionality and ease of use.

   Furthermore, `~.GraphScene` has been deprecated and we encourage use of the above functions instead. It can still be used because :class:`NumberLineOld` was introduced to accommodate these changes.

* `#1013 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/1013>`__: Refactored the Command Line Interface to use Click instead of Argparse
   This change breaks the CLI API to organize the structure of Manim Community's commands, options, and arguments.

   To be more in line with POSIX compliant CLI conventions, options for commands are given _**BEFORE**_ their arguments.
   In Argparse: ``manim basic.py -p -ql``
   With Click: ``manim -p -ql basic.py``

   Although this is primarily a refactor and most of the common options are still there, some options have been added/removed. Use the ``manim`` command's ``-h``, ``--help`` option, or simply run the command without providing options/arguments to view the help page with the full list of subcommands/options/arguments.

   - Added a ``--fps``/``--frame_rate`` option which allows for custom fps that don't have to be integer (i.e. 29.97, 23.98, etc.). Users no longer have to specify the FPS from within a config file. Additionally, the ``--webgl_renderer_fps`` option has been removed. Use ``--fps`` or ``--frame_rate`` instead.
   - Added a ``--renderer`` option which you can use to select your choice of renderer (e.g. ``--renderer=opengl``). There are currently *THREE* renderers to choose from!
   - Removed the ``--background_color`` option. Reassigned the ``--background_color`` option's shorthand ``-c`` to ``--config_file``.
   - Removed the ``--leave_progress_bars`` option. Use ``--progress_bars=leave`` instead.
   - Removed the deprecated render quality flags, in particular: ``-l``, ``-m``, ``-h``, ``-k``.
   - Removed the ``--sound`` option. It lost support long ago with the removal of SoX.
