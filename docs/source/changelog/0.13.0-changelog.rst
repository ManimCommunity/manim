----------

* `#2325 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/2325>`__: `quality` argument improvements
   * Updated the `quality` option values and help string to be automatically generated from `constants` (there was a mismatch between these before)
   * Not passing `quality` argument will now use the `pixel_height`, `pixel_width` and `frame_rate` from config instead of overwriting them with `DEFAULT_QUANTITY` settings
   * `quality` now can be set inside `manim.cfg` files
   * Removed trailing zeros from frame rates in video directories names

* `#2328 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/2328>`__: Provide alpha multiplied RGBA values to cairo
   `Format.ARGB32` in pycairo uses pre-multiplied alpha as per [documentation](https://pycairo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/enums.html#cairo.Format.ARGB32). Manim incorrectly passed non-multiplied alpha, which was fixed.
