Fixed bugs
----------

* `#1729 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/1729>`__: Fix bug when using Text with the opengl renderer.


* `#1675 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/1675>`__: Set attributes from svgmobject

* `#1678 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/1678>`__: Fixed rate functions and lag ratios
   - Fixed animations so that certain rate functions (`running_start`, `wiggle`, `ease_in_back`, `ease_out_back`, `ease_in_out_back`, `ease_in_elastic`, `ease_out_elastic`, and `ease_out_elastic`) can go outside the range from 0 to 1.
   - Fixed lag ratios so that they're spaced out evenly within the time interval and the rate functions are applied to each animation individually, rather than having the rate function determine when the animation starts.
   - Fixed faulty code for `ease_in_out_expo`, `ease_in_bounce`, `ease_out_bounce`, and `ease_in_out_bounce`.
