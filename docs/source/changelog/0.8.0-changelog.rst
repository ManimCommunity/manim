   Rewrite vectorized mobject shaders to be compatible with transformation matrices.

* `#1695 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/1695>`__: Add option to justify text with :class:`~.MarkupText`
   A new parameter ``justify`` is added to :class:`~.MarkupText`. It can be used to justify a paragraph of text.

* `#1660 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/1660>`__: Added support for ``.webm`` and transparency of videos in Jupyter notebooks
   - Added support for generating ``webm`` videos via the command line flag ``--format=webm``
   - Added transparency support for Jupyter notebooks

* `#1553 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/1553>`__: Add dearpygui integration


Enhancements
------------

* `#1728 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/1728>`__: Improved positioning and size of the OpenGL window; added some configuration options


* `#1733 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/1733>`__: Let OpenGLMobject.copy return a deep copy by default


* `#1735 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/1735>`__: Metaclass compatibility for `coordinate_system.py`, `Code` and `ParametricSurface`


* `#1585 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/1585>`__: OpenGL compatibility via metaclass for :class:`~.Matrix`, :class:`~.DecimalNumber`, :class:`~.Variable`


* `#1713 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/1713>`__: Exit the command line interface gracefully if no scene was chosen


* `#1652 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/1652>`__: Refactored :class:`~.Mobject` and :class:`~.Scene` to no longer inherit from the abstract base class ``Container``
   - Moved tests in ``test_container.py`` for :class:`Container` that test :class:`~.Scene` and :class:`~.Mobject` to their own files.
   - Corrected various instances of incorrectly passed keyword arguments, or unused keyword arguments.

* `#1693 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/1693>`__: Made the default arrowhead size for :class:`~.Arrow3D` smaller


* `#1678 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/1678>`__: Allow some rate functions to assume values outside of [0, 1]; introduce clamping decorators
   - Fixed animations so that certain rate functions (``running_start``, ``wiggle``, ``ease_in_back``, ``ease_out_back``, ``ease_in_out_back``, ``ease_in_elastic``, ``ease_out_elastic``, and ``ease_out_elastic``) can go outside the range from 0 to 1.
   - Fixed lag ratios so that they're spaced out evenly within the time interval and the rate functions are applied to each animation individually, rather than having the rate function determine when the animation starts.
   - Fixed faulty code for ``ease_in_out_expo``, ``ease_in_bounce``, ``ease_out_bounce``, and ``ease_in_out_bounce``.

* `#1649 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/1649>`__: Made video file names in Jupyter notebook more readable


* `#1667 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/1667>`__: Determine the default number of decimal places for :class:`~.NumberLine` labels automatically from the step size
   As an example: If the step size is set to 0.5, labels will now show at least one decimal place.

* `#1608 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/1608>`__: Color file paths in terminal; remove curly braces surrounding the file path in "Partial movie file written in..." messages


* `#1632 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/1632>`__: OpenGL compatibility via metaclass: :class:`~.Group`
