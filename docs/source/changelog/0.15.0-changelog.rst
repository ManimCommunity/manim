Breaking changes
----------------

* `#2476 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/2476>`__: Improved structure of the :mod:`.mobject` module
   Arrow tips now have to be imported from ``manim.mobject.geometry.tips`` instead of ``manim.mobject.geometry``.

* `#2387 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/2387>`__: Refactored :class:`~.BarChart` and made it inherit from :class:`~.Axes`
   - :class:`~.BarChart` now inherits from :class:`~.Axes`, allowing it to use :class:`~.Axes`' methods. Also improves :class:`~.BarChart`'s configuration and ease of use.
   - Added :meth:`~.BarChart.get_bar_labels` to annotate the value of each bar of a :class:`~.BarChart`.

Deprecated classes and functions
--------------------------------

* `#2568 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/2568>`__: Removed Deprecated Methods
   Removed methods and classes that were deprecated since v0.10.0 and v0.11.0

   - Replaced old implementation of the choose function with scipy's implementation
   - Use ``lru_cache`` (least recently used cache) for caching the choose function. Since it's only used for beziers, only 2 choose k and 3 choose k will be used, hence a size of 10 should be enough.
   - Removed ``clip_in_place`` in favor of ``np.clip``
   - Removed one use of ``clip_in_place`` that wasn't actually doing anything

* `#2439 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/2439>`__: Removed twitter template from scripts
