Pull requests merged
====================

A total of 58 pull requests were merged for this release.

Breaking changes
----------------

* `#2387 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/2387>`__: Refactored :class:`~.BarChart` and made it inherit from :class:`~.Axes`
   - :class:`~.BarChart` now inherits from :class:`~.Axes`, allowing it to use :class:`Axes`' methods. Also improves :class:`BarChart`'s configuration and ease of use.
   - Added :meth:`~.BarChart.add_bar_labels` to annotate the value of each bar of a :class:`~.BarChart`.

Deprecated classes and functions
--------------------------------

* `#2457 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/2457>`__: Deprecated :class:`.ShowCreationThenFadeOut`


New features
------------

* `#2504 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/2504>`__: Added finer control over :meth:`.Scene.wait` being static (i.e., no updaters) or not
   - Added keyword argument ``frozen_frame`` to :class:`.Wait` and :meth:`.Scene.wait`
   - New convenience method: :meth:`.Scene.pause` (alias for ``Scene.wait(frozen_frame=True)``)
   - Changed default behavior for OpenGL updaters: updater functions are now not called by default when they are added
   - Changed default behavior of :meth:`.Scene.should_mobjects_update`: made it respect the set value of ``Wait.frozen_frame``, changed automatic determination of frozen frame state to also consider Scene updaters

Enhancements
------------

Code quality improvements and similar refactors
-----------------------------------------------

* `#2472 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/2472>`__: Removed unnecessary comment in :mod:`.simple_functions`


* `#2429 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/2429>`__: Upgraded to future-style type annotations


* `#2464 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/2464>`__: Bump pillow from 8.4.0 to 9.0.0

* `#2437 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/2437>`__: Cleaned up :mod:`.simple_functions`

   - Replaced old implementation of the choose function with scipy's implementation
   - Use `lru_cache` (least recently used cache) for caching the choose function. Since it's only used for beziers, only 2 choose k and 3 choose k will be used, hence a size of 10 should be enough.
   - Removed `clip_in_place` in favor of `np.clip`
   - Removed one use of `clip_in_place` that wasn't actually doing anything

* `#2439 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/2439>`__: Removed twitter template from scripts
