Pull requests merged
====================

A total of 35 pull requests were merged for this release.

New features
------------

* :pr:`2534`: Implement `OpenGLImageMobject`


* :pr:`2684`: Created a more accessible way to create Angles with line.py angle function - Angle.from_three_points
   Added a function to create an angle object with three points. In addition, we added a test within the test_geometry.py that instantiates an angle object with three points.

* :pr:`2404`: Add SpiralIn Animation


Enhancements
------------

* :pr:`2693`: Allow using :meth:`.MovingCamera.auto_zoom` without animation
   Allows auto zooming camera without having to play an animation by passing an `animation=False` argument

* :pr:`2665`: Improved handling of attributes when using the ``.animate`` syntax


* :pr:`2655`: Fix `assert_is_mobject_method` when using OpenGL


* :pr:`2642`: Migrated file_ops.py and scene_file_writer.py from os.path to Pathlib
   In file_ops.py and scene_file_writer.py: Uses of str type file names have have been mostly (see further information) converted to Pathlib Path objects. Uses of os.path methods have been converted to equivalent Pathlib methods.

Fixed bugs
----------

* :pr:`2688`: Fixed two minor issues of :class:`.SpiralIn` and :class:`.ManimBanner`


* :pr:`2648`: Handle user-defined centers for Wiggle animation
   Fixes a minor bug in the Wiggle animation where user-defined centers are ignored.

* :pr:`2658`: Fix arguments of overridden `set_style` for `BackgroundRectangle`
   Fixes issue #2337:
   Using `Write()` animation on a `Text` object with `.add_background_rectangle()` applied no longer generates a `TypeError`.

* :pr:`2676`: Fixed opengl finish transform


* :pr:`2668`: (Re)set background color of :class:`.OpenGLRenderer` when initializing scene


* :pr:`2546`: Fixed a File logging bug and some maintenance


* :pr:`2613`: Fixed bug in :meth:`.Circle.point_at_angle` when the angle is not in the interval :math:`[0, 2\pi]`


Documentation-related changes
-----------------------------

* :pr:`2686`: Add instructions to install extra dependencies with poetry


* :pr:`2640`: Copyedited Documentation
   Reviewed tutorials\configurations.rst. Edited simple mistakes such as Manim not being capitalized and commas.

* :pr:`2663`: Added documentation for scene updater functions


* :pr:`2651`: Update copyright year in documentation to 2020-2022
   Updates year in conf.py to correct year in the footer of the documentation.

   Would resolve https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/issues/2650 if merged

* :pr:`2609`: Copy Edit troubleshooting.rst


* :pr:`2610`: Add example PolygonOnAxes


* :pr:`2619`: Improve Example for arrange_in_grid


* :pr:`2620`: Fixed typo in :meth:`.Animation.is_introducer`


* :pr:`2617`: Re-added :mod:`.value_tracker` documentation


Changes to our development infrastructure
-----------------------------------------

* :pr:`2656`: Fixed incompatibility with black version


* :pr:`2561`: Run tests on Linux-aarch64


Code quality improvements and similar refactors
-----------------------------------------------

* :pr:`2696`: Improve `scripts/dev_changelog.py`


* :pr:`2691`:  Removed :class:`CameraFrame`


* :pr:`2678`: Require `backports-cached-property` only for Python < 3.8


* :pr:`2630`: Remove WebGL renderer
   The WebGL renderer is broken and is unmaintained anymore. The support for it in Manim is removed.

Unclassified changes
--------------------

* :pr:`2674`: Document and type `simple_functions.py`
   - Just some short and sweet documentation for `simple_functions.py` along with a general neatening up. ðŸ™‚.
   - Small additions with some extra clarity for these functions (same style as my recent PR for `iterables.py` (#2649)

* :pr:`2634`: Fix background lines drawn twice in `NumberPlane`


* :pr:`2649`: Document and type utils/iterables.py
   - `utils/iterables.py` has been **fully documented** (including examples to demonstrate usage) and **typed**

* :pr:`2597`: Fix Bug in :class:`Uncreate` with ``rate_func`` via introducing new parameter ``reversed`` to :class:`Animation`
   Refractor the :class:`Uncreate`. The new implementation uses a flag member :param:`reversed`. Set it to ``True`` and its superclass handles the reverse.

   Introduce a bool parameter ``reversed`` to :class:`Animation`. It decides whether the animation needs to be played backwards. Default to be False.
   Add conditional branches in :func:`Animation.get_sub_alpha`. If the parameter ``reversed`` is True, it would set ``rate_func(t)`` to ``rate_func(1 - t)``.

* :pr:`2652`: Update cloup version to 0.13.0 from 0.7.0
   This PR updates the cloup version from 0.7.0 to 0.13.0 as requested in #2614

* :pr:`2062`: Reuse shader wrappers and shader data
