Breaking changes
----------------

* `#1521 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/1521>`__: Improve Animation docs
   - Improve documentation of the Animation class.

   Manim won't work on Python 3.6 anymore.

   - Add :class:`~.Polygram`, a generalized :class:`~.Polygon` that allows for disconnected sets of edges.
   - Make :class:`~.Polygon` inherit from :class:`~.Polygram`.
   - Add :func:`~.regular_vertices`

   - Replaced `BLUE_E` with what was previously `DARK_BLUE` and removed `DARK_BLUE`
   - Added alias `LIGHTER_GRAY` for `GRAY_A`
   - Added `PURE_RED`, `PURE_BLUE` and renamed `GREEN_SCREEN` to `PURE_GREEN`
   - All gray colors are now also available using British spelling (including `GREY_BROWN`)
   - Replaced color example in the docs. It can now be used as a quick reference for all color names.

* `#1272 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/1272>`__: Implement metaclass approach in geometry module to make mobjects compatible with cairo and opengl rendering


* `#1418 <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/pull/1418>`__: Added project management commands
   - ``manim init`` - quickly sets up default files for a manim project.
   - ``manim new project`` - lets the user set project settings. It also creates the project inside a new folder of name <project_name>
   - ``manim new scene`` - used to quickly insert new scenes into files. If ``file name`` is not provided ``main.py`` is used as default.
