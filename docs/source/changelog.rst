manimce-v1.0.0-dev
==================

:Date: TBD

This is the first release of manimce after forking from 3b1b/manim.  As such,
developers have focused on cleaning up and refactoring the codebase while still
maintaining backwards compatibility wherever possible.


New Features
------------


Command line
^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Add 4k rendering option with the :code:`-k` option
#. High quality rendering has gotten its own short argument (:code:`-e`)
#. Output of 'manim --help' has been improved
#. Implement logging with the :code:`rich` library and a :code:`logger` object instead of plain ol` prints
#. Added a flag :code:`--dry_run`, which doesn’t write any media
#. Allow for running manim with :code:`python3 -m manim`
#. Refactored Tex Template management. You can now use custom templates with command line args using :code:`--tex_template`!
#. Re-add :code:`--save_frames` flag, which will save each frame as a png
#. Re-introduce manim feature that allows you to type manim code in :code:`stdin` if you pass a minus sign :code:`(-)` as filename
#. Added the :code:`--custom_folders` flag which yields a simpler output folder structure
#. Re-implement GIF export with the :code:`-i` flag (using this flag outputs ONLY a .gif file, and no .mp4 file)
#. Added a :code:`--verbose` flag
#. You can save the logs to a file by using :code:`--log_to_file`


Config system
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Implement a :code:`manim.cfg` config file system, that consolidates the global configuration, the command line argument parsing, and some of the constants defined in :code:`constants.py`
#. Added utilities for manipulating Manim’s :code:`.cfg` files.
#. Added a subcommand structure for easier use of utilities managing :code:`.cfg` files


Mobjects, Scenes, and Animations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Add customizable left and right bracket for :code:`Matrix` mobject and :code:`set_row_colors` method for matrix mobject
#. Add :code:`AddTeXLetterByLetter` animation
#. Enhanced GraphScene
    #. You can now add arrow tips to axes
    #. extend axes a bit at the start and/or end
    #. have invisible axes
    #. highlight the area between two curves
#. ThreeDScene now supports 3dillusion_camera_rotation
#. Add :code:`z_index` for manipulating depth of Objects on scene.
#. Add a :code:`VDict` class: a :code:`VDict` is to a :code:`VGroup` what a :code:`dict` is to a :code:`list`
#. Added Scene-caching feature. Now, if a partial movie file is unchanged in your code, it isn’t rendered again! [HIGHLY UNSTABLE We're working on it ;)]
#. Most :code:`get_` and :code:`set_` methods have been removed in favor of instance attributes and properties
#. The :code:`Container` class has been made into an AbstractBaseClass, i.e. in cannot be instantiated.  Instead, use one of its children classes


Documentation
-------------

#. Added clearer installation instructions, tutorials, examples, and API reference [WIP]


Fixes
-----
#. Initialization of directories has been moved to :code:`config.py`, and a bunch of bugs associated to file structure generation have been fixed
#. Nonfunctional file :code:`media_dir.txt` has been removed
#. Nonfunctional :code:`if` statements in :code:`scene_file_writer.py` have been removed
#. Fix a bug where trying to render the example scenes without specifying the scene would show all scene objects in the library
#. Many :code:`Exceptions` have been replaced for more specific exception subclasses
#. Fixed a couple of subtle bugs in :code:`ArcBetweenPoints`


Of interest to developers
-------------------------

#. Python code formatting is now enforced by using the :code:`black` tool
#. PRs now require two approving code reviews from community devs before they can be merged
#. Added tests to ensure stuff doesn’t break between commits (For developers) [Uses Github CI, and Pytest]
#. Add contribution guidelines (for developers)
#. Added autogenerated documentation with sphinx and autodoc/autosummary [WIP]
#. Made manim internally use relative imports
#. Since the introduction of the :code:`TexTemplate` class, the files :code:`tex_template.tex` and :code:`ctex_template.tex` have been removed


Other Changes
--------------
#. Cleanup 3b1b Specific Files
#. Rename package from manimlib to manim
#. Move all imports to :code:`__init__`, so :code:`from manim import *` replaces :code:`from manimlib.imports import *`
#. Global dir variable handling has been removed. Instead :code:`initialize_directories`, if needed, overrides the values from the cfg files at runtime.
