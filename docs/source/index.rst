Manim Community Overview
========================

Animating technical concepts is traditionally pretty tedious since it can be
difficult to make the animations precise enough to convey them accurately.
``Manim`` uses Python to generate animations programmatically, making it
possible to specify exactly how each one should run.

This project is still very much a work in progress, but we hope that the
information here will make it easier for newcomers to get started using
``Manim``.
