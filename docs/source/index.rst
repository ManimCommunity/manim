Manim Community Edition
=======================

Animating technical concepts is traditionally pretty tedious since it can be
difficult to make the animations precise enough to convey them accurately.
Manim relies on Python's simplicity to generate animations programmatically,
making it convenient to specify exactly how each one should run. Take a look
at the :doc:`Example Gallery <../examples>` for some inspiration on how to
create beautiful images and videos with Manim.

First Steps
-----------

Are you new to Manim and are looking for where to get started? Then you are
in the right place!

.. note::

   Please be aware that there are different, incompatible versions
   of Manim available. Check our :ref:`installation FAQ <different-versions>`
   to learn more!

- The :doc:`Installation <installation>` section has the latest and
  up-to-date installation instructions for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
  You can also find information on Manim's docker images and (online)
  notebook environments there.
- Want to try the library before installing it? Take a look at our
  interactive online playground at https://try.manim.community in form
  of a Jupyter notebook.
- In our :doc:`Tutorials <tutorials/index>` section you will find a
  collection of resources that will teach you how to use Manim. In particular,
  the :doc:`tutorials/quickstart` tutorial teaches you Manim's basics,
  and in :doc:`tutorials/building_blocks` the classes used to compose
  your animations are described in more detail.
