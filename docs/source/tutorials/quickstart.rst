Quickstart
==========

.. note::
 Before proceeding, install Manim and make sure it's running properly by
 following the steps in :doc:`../installation`. For
 information on using Manim with Jupyterlab or Jupyter notebook, go to the
 documentation for the
 :meth:`IPython magic command <manim.utils.ipython_magic.ManimMagic.manim>`,
 ``%%manim``.

Overview
********

This quickstart guide will lead you through creating a sample project using Manim: an animation
engine for precise programmatic animations.

First, you will use a command line
interface to create a ``Scene``, the class through which Manim generates videos.
In the ``Scene`` you will animate a circle. Then you will add another ``Scene`` showing
a square transforming into a circle. This will be your introduction to Manim's animation ability.
Afterwards, you will position multiple mathematical objects (``Mobject``\s). Finally, you
will learn the ``.animate`` syntax, a powerful feature that animates the methods you
use to modify ``Mobject``\s.


Starting a new project
**********************

Start by creating a new folder. For the purposes of this guide, name the folder ``project``:

.. code-block:: bash

   project/

This folder is the root folder for your project. It contains all the files that Manim needs to function,
as well as any output that your project produces.


Animating a circle
******************

1. Open a text editor, such as Notepad. Copy the following code snippet into the window:

.. code-block:: python

   from manim import *


   class CreateCircle(Scene):
       def construct(self):
           circle = Circle()  # create a circle
           circle.set_fill(PINK, opacity=0.5)  # set the color and transparency
           self.play(Create(circle))  # show the circle on screen

2. Save the code snippet into your project folder with the name ``scene.py``.

.. code-block:: bash

   project/
   └─scene.py

3. Open the command line, navigate to your project folder, and execute
the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   manim -pql scene.py CreateCircle

Manim will output rendering information, then create an MP4 file.
Your default movie player will play the MP4 file, displaying the following animation.

.. manim:: CreateCircle
   :hide_source:

   class CreateCircle(Scene):
       def construct(self):
           circle = Circle()                   # create a circle
           circle.set_fill(PINK, opacity=0.5)  # set the color and transparency
           self.play(Create(circle))     # show the circle on screen

If you see an animation of a pink circle being drawn, congratulations!
You just wrote your first Manim scene from scratch.

If you get an error
message instead, you do not see a video, or if the video output does not
look like the preceding animation, it is likely that Manim has not been
installed correctly. Please refer to our :doc:`FAQ section </faq/index>`
for help with the most common issues.


***********
Explanation
***********

Let's go over the script you just executed line by line to see how Manim was
able to draw the circle.

The first line imports all of the contents of the library:

.. code-block:: python

   from manim import *

This is the recommended way of using Manim, as a single script often uses
multiple names from the Manim namespace. In your script, you imported and used
``Scene``, ``Circle``, ``PINK`` and ``Create``.

Now let's look at the next two lines:

.. code-block:: python

   class CreateCircle(Scene):
       def construct(self):
           ...

Most of the time, the code for scripting an animation is entirely contained within
the :meth:`~.Scene.construct` method of a :class:`.Scene` class.
Inside :meth:`~.Scene.construct`, you can create objects, display them on screen, and animate them.

The next two lines create a circle and set its color and opacity:

.. code-block:: python

           circle = Circle()  # create a circle
           circle.set_fill(PINK, opacity=0.5)  # set the color and transparency

Finally, the last line uses the animation :class:`.Create` to display the
circle on your screen:

.. code-block:: python

           self.play(Create(circle))  # show the circle on screen

.. tip:: All animations must reside within the :meth:`~.Scene.construct` method of a
         class derived from :class:`.Scene`.  Other code, such as auxiliary
         or mathematical functions, may reside outside the class.


Transforming a square into a circle
***********************************

With our circle animation complete, let's move on to something a little more complicated.

1. Open ``scene.py``, and add the following code snippet below the ``CreateCircle`` class:

.. code-block:: python

   class SquareToCircle(Scene):
       def construct(self):
           circle = Circle()  # create a circle
           circle.set_fill(PINK, opacity=0.5)  # set color and transparency

           square = Square()  # create a square
           square.rotate(PI / 4)  # rotate a certain amount

           self.play(Create(square))  # animate the creation of the square
           self.play(Transform(square, circle))  # interpolate the square into the circle
           self.play(FadeOut(square))  # fade out animation

2. Render ``SquareToCircle`` by running the following command in the command line:

.. code-block:: bash

   manim -pql scene.py SquareToCircle

The following animation will render:

.. manim:: SquareToCircle2
   :hide_source:

   class SquareToCircle2(Scene):
       def construct(self):
           circle = Circle()  # create a circle
           circle.set_fill(PINK, opacity=0.5)  # set color and transparency

           square = Square()  # create a square
           square.rotate(PI / 4)  # rotate a certain amount

           self.play(Create(square))  # animate the creation of the square
           self.play(Transform(square, circle))  # interpolate the square into the circle
           self.play(FadeOut(square))  # fade out animation

This example shows one of the primary features of Manim: the ability to
implement complicated and mathematically intensive animations (such as cleanly
interpolating between two geometric shapes) with just a few lines of code.


Positioning ``Mobject``\s
*************************

Next, let's go over some basic techniques for positioning ``Mobject``\s.

1. Open ``scene.py``, and add the following code snippet below the ``SquareToCircle`` method:

.. code-block:: python

   class SquareAndCircle(Scene):
       def construct(self):
           circle = Circle()  # create a circle
           circle.set_fill(PINK, opacity=0.5)  # set the color and transparency

           square = Square()  # create a square
           square.set_fill(BLUE, opacity=0.5)  # set the color and transparency

           square.next_to(circle, RIGHT, buff=0.5)  # set the position
           self.play(Create(circle), Create(square))  # show the shapes on screen

2. Render ``SquareAndCircle`` by running the following command in the command line:

.. code-block:: bash

   manim -pql scene.py SquareAndCircle

The following animation will render:

.. manim:: SquareAndCircle2
   :hide_source:

   class SquareAndCircle2(Scene):
       def construct(self):
           circle = Circle()  # create a circle
           circle.set_fill(PINK, opacity=0.5)  # set the color and transparency

           square = Square() # create a square
           square.set_fill(BLUE, opacity=0.5) # set the color and transparency

           square.next_to(circle, RIGHT, buff=0.5) # set the position
           self.play(Create(circle), Create(square))  # show the shapes on screen

``next_to`` is a ``Mobject`` method for positioning ``Mobject``\s.

We first specified
the pink circle as the square's reference point by passing ``circle`` as the method's first argument.
The second argument is used to specify the direction the ``Mobject`` is placed relative to the reference point.
In this case, we set the direction to ``RIGHT``, telling Manim to position the square to the right of the circle.
Finally, ``buff=0.5`` applied a small distance buffer between the two objects.

Try changing ``RIGHT`` to ``LEFT``, ``UP``, or ``DOWN`` instead, and see how that changes the position of the square.

Using positioning methods, you can render a scene with multiple ``Mobject``\s,
setting their locations in the scene using coordinates or positioning them
relative to each other.

For more information on ``next_to`` and other positioning methods, check out the
list of :class:`.Mobject` methods in our reference manual.


Using ``.animate`` syntax to animate methods
********************************************

The final lesson in this tutorial is using ``.animate``, a ``Mobject`` method which
animates changes you make to a ``Mobject``. When you prepend ``.animate`` to any
method call that modifies a ``Mobject``, the method becomes an animation which
can be played using ``self.play``. Let's return to ``SquareToCircle`` to see the
differences between using methods when creating a ``Mobject``,
and animating those method calls with ``.animate``.

1. Open ``scene.py``, and add the following code snippet below the ``SquareAndCircle`` class:

.. code-block:: python

   class AnimatedSquareToCircle(Scene):
       def construct(self):
           circle = Circle()  # create a circle
           square = Square()  # create a square

           self.play(Create(square))  # show the square on screen
           self.play(square.animate.rotate(PI / 4))  # rotate the square
           self.play(
               ReplacementTransform(square, circle)
           )  # transform the square into a circle
           self.play(
               circle.animate.set_fill(PINK, opacity=0.5)
           )  # color the circle on screen

2. Render ``AnimatedSquareToCircle`` by running the following command in the command line:

.. code-block:: bash

   manim -pql scene.py AnimatedSquareToCircle

The following animation will render:

.. manim:: AnimatedSquareToCircle2
   :hide_source:

   class AnimatedSquareToCircle2(Scene):
       def construct(self):
           circle = Circle()  # create a circle
           square = Square()  # create a square

           self.play(Create(square))  # show the square on screen
           self.play(square.animate.rotate(PI / 4))  # rotate the square
           self.play(ReplacementTransform(square, circle))  # transform the square into a circle
           self.play(circle.animate.set_fill(PINK, opacity=0.5))  # color the circle on screen

The first ``self.play`` creates the square. The second animates rotating it 45 degrees.
The third transforms the square into a circle, and the last colors the circle pink.
Although the end result is the same as that of ``SquareToCircle``, ``.animate`` shows
``rotate`` and ``set_fill`` being applied to the ``Mobject`` dynamically, instead of creating them
with the changes already applied.

Try other methods, like ``flip`` or ``shift``, and see what happens.

3. Open ``scene.py``, and add the following code snippet below the ``AnimatedSquareToCircle`` class:

.. code-block:: python

   class DifferentRotations(Scene):
       def construct(self):
           left_square = Square(color=BLUE, fill_opacity=0.7).shift(2 * LEFT)
           right_square = Square(color=GREEN, fill_opacity=0.7).shift(2 * RIGHT)
           self.play(
               left_square.animate.rotate(PI), Rotate(right_square, angle=PI), run_time=2
           )
           self.wait()

4. Render ``DifferentRotations`` by running the following command in the command line:

.. code-block:: bash

   manim -pql scene.py DifferentRotations

The following animation will render:

.. manim:: DifferentRotations2
   :hide_source:

   class DifferentRotations2(Scene):
       def construct(self):
           left_square = Square(color=BLUE, fill_opacity=0.7).shift(2*LEFT)
           right_square = Square(color=GREEN, fill_opacity=0.7).shift(2*RIGHT)
           self.play(left_square.animate.rotate(PI), Rotate(right_square, angle=PI), run_time=2)
           self.wait()

This ``Scene`` illustrates the quirks of ``.animate``. When using ``.animate``, Manim
actually takes a ``Mobject``'s starting state and its ending state and interpolates the two.
In the ``AnimatedSquareToCircle`` class, you can observe this when the square rotates:
the corners of the square appear to contract slightly as they move into the positions required
for the first square to transform into the second one.

In ``DifferentRotations``, the difference between ``.animate``'s interpretation of rotation and the
``Rotate`` method is far more apparent. The starting and ending states of a ``Mobject`` rotated 360 degrees
are the same, so ``.animate`` tries to interpolate two identical objects and the result is the left square.
If you find that your own usage of ``.animate`` is causing similar unwanted behavior, consider
using conventional animation methods like the right square, which uses ``Rotate``.
