For the sake of simplicity, the following instructions assume that you have
the popular `package manager Homebrew <https://brew.sh>`__ installed. While
you can certainly also install all dependencies without it, using Homebrew
makes the process much easier.

If you want to use Homebrew but do not have it installed yet, please
follow `Homebrew's installation instructions <https://docs.brew.sh/Installation>`__.

.. note::

   For a while after Apple released its new ARM-based processors (the Apple Silicon chips like the *"M1 chip"*),
   the recommended way of installing Manim relied on *Rosetta*, Apple's compatibility
   layer between Intel and ARM architectures. This is no longer necessary, Manim can
   (and is recommended to) be installed natively.


Installing Manim
----------------

As of July/2024, brew can install Manim including all required dependencies.
To install Manim:

.. code-block:: bash

   brew install manim

.. _macos-optional-dependencies:

Optional Dependencies
---------------------

In order to make use of Manim's interface to LaTeX for, e.g., rendering
equations, LaTeX has to be installed as well. Note that this is an optional
dependency: if you don't intend to use LaTeX, you don't have to install it.

For macOS, the recommended LaTeX distribution is
`MacTeX <http://www.tug.org/mactex/>`__. You can install it by following
the instructions from the link, or alternatively also via Homebrew by
running:

.. code-block:: bash

   brew install --cask mactex-no-gui

.. warning::

   MacTeX is a *full* LaTeX distribution and will require more than 4GB of
   disk space. If this is an issue for you, consider installing a smaller
   distribution like
   `BasicTeX <http://www.tug.org/mactex/morepackages.html>`__.

Should you choose to work with some partial TeX distribution, the full list
of LaTeX packages which Manim interacts with in some way (a subset might
be sufficient for your particular application) is::

   amsmath babel-english cbfonts-fd cm-super ctex doublestroke dvisvgm everysel
   fontspec frcursive fundus-calligra gnu-freefont jknapltx latex-bin

Working with Manim
------------------

At this point, you should have a working installation of Manim. Head

how to make your own *Manimations*!
