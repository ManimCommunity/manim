macOS
=====

For the sake of simplicity, the following instructions assume that you have
the popular `package manager Homebrew <https://brew.sh>`__ installed. While
you can certainly also install all dependencies without it, using Homebrew
makes the process much easier.

If you want to use Homebrew but do not have it installed yet, please
follow `Homebrew's installation instructions <https://docs.brew.sh/Installation>`__.

.. note::

   For a while after Apple released its new ARM-based processors (the Apple Silicon chips like the *"M1 chip"*),
   the recommended way of installing Manim relied on *Rosetta*, Apple's compatibility
   layer between Intel and ARM architectures. This is no longer necessary, Manim can
   (and is recommended to) be installed natively.


Required Dependencies
---------------------

To install all required dependencies for installing Manim (namely: ffmpeg, Python,
and some required Python packages), run:

.. code-block:: bash

   brew install py3cairo ffmpeg

On *Apple Silicon* based machines (i.e., devices with the M1 chip or similar; if
you are unsure which processor you have check by opening the Apple menu, select
*About This Mac* and check the entry next to *Chip*), some additional dependencies
are required, namely:

.. code-block:: bash

   brew install pango pkg-config scipy

After all required dependencies are installed, simply run:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip3 install manim

to install Manim.

.. note::

   A frequent source for installation problems is if ``pip3``
   does not point to the correct Python installation on your system.
   To check this, run ``pip3 -V``: for macOS Intel, the path should
   start with ``/usr/local``, and for Apple Silicon with
   ``/opt/homebrew``. If this is not the case, you either forgot
   to modify your shell profile (``.zprofile``) during the installation
   of Homebrew, or did not reload your shell (e.g., by opening a new
   terminal) after doing so. It is also possible that some other
   software (like Pycharm) changed the ``PATH`` variable â€“ to fix this,
   make sure that the Homebrew-related lines in your ``.zprofile`` are
   at the very end of the file.

Optional Dependencies
---------------------

In order to make use of Manim's interface to LaTeX for, e.g., rendering
equations, LaTeX has to be installed as well. Note that this is an optional
dependency: if you don't intend to use LaTeX, you don't have to install it.

For macOS, the recommended LaTeX distribution is
`MacTeX <http://www.tug.org/mactex/>`__. You can install it by following
the instructions from the link, or alternatively also via Homebrew by
running:

.. code-block:: bash

   brew install --cask mactex-no-gui

.. warning::

   MacTeX is a *full* LaTeX distribution and will require more than 4GB of
   disk space. If this is an issue for you, consider installing a smaller
   distribution like
   `BasicTeX <http://www.tug.org/mactex/morepackages.html>`__.

Should you choose to work with some partial TeX distribution, the full list
of LaTeX packages which Manim interacts with in some way (a subset might
be sufficient for your particular application) is::

   amsmath babel-english cbfonts-fd cm-super ctex doublestroke dvisvgm everysel

Working with Manim
------------------

At this point, you should have a working installation of Manim. Head

how to make your own *Manimations*!
