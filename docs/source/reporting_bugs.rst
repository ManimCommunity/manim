Reporting bugs
===============

One of the best ways of contributing to Manim is by reporting bugs.  If you
have encountered something that you believe is a bug, please follow these
steps:

1. First of all, make sure you are running the latest version of manim.  If
   not, update your version and try again.

2. Search for other users who may have had similar issues in the
   past. Search the repository's `issues page <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/issues>`_ (don't forget to search closed
   issues), bring it up on our `Discord server <https://www.manim.community/discord/>`_, use sites like StackOverflow, and exercise
   your best Google practices.  If you can't find anything helpful, then go to
   the next step.

3. Can reproduce the issue, i.e. that you have some code that
   illustrates the bug **every time** (or at least most of the time) it is
   executed.

4. Clarify what behavior you expected, and how the actual behavior
   differs from your expectation.

5. Gather information about your environment, such as your
   operating system, python version, and any stack traces that the code may
   have generated (if applicable).

4. Please open an issue only after you have gathered this information. When
   submitting an issue, make sure to follow the template (this is the default
   text you are shown when first opening the 'New Issue' page).  A community
   member will (hopefully) respond and start a conversation to address the
   issue.

7. Please give the community a reasonable amount of time before asking again,
   or insisting on your issue.  Keep in mind that everyone is a volunteer.  If
   you wait for a reasonable amount of time and you receive no response, feel
   free to ask again.
