Adding type hints to functions and parameters
---------------------------------------------

Manim is currently in the process of adding type hints into the library. In this
section, you will find information about the standards used and some general
guidelines.

If you've never used type hints before, this is a good place to get started:
https://realpython.com/python-type-checking/#hello-types.

Typing standards
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Manim uses `mypy`_ to type check its codebase. You will find a list of
configuration values in the ``mypy.ini`` configuration file.

To be able to use the newest typing features not available in the lowest
supported Python version, make use of `typing_extensions`_.

To be able to use the new Union syntax (``|``) and builtins subscripting, use
the ``from __future__ import annotations`` import.

.. _mypy: https://mypy-lang.org/
.. _typing_extensions: https://pypi.org/project/typing-extensions/

Typing guidelines
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Manim has a dedicated :mod:`~.typing` module where type aliases are provided.
  Most of them may seem redundant, in particular the ones related to ``numpy``.
  This is in anticipation of the support for shape type hinting
  (`related issue <https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/16544>`_). Besides the
  pending shape support, using the correct type aliases will help users understand
  which shape should be used.

* For typings of generic collections, check out `this <https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.abc.html#collections-abstract-base-classes>`_
  link.

* Always use a type hint of ``None`` for functions that does not return
  a value (this also applies to ``__init__``), e.g.:

.. code:: py

    def height(self, value) -> None:
        self.scale_to_fit_height(value)

* For variables representing paths, use the ``StrPath`` or ``StrOrBytesPath``
  type alias defined in the :mod:`~.typing` module.

* ``*args`` and ``**kwargs`` shouldn't be left untyped (in most cases you can
  use ``Any``).

* Following `PEP 484 <https://peps.python.org/pep-0484/#the-numeric-tower>`_,
  use ``float`` instead of ``int | float``.

* Use ``x | y`` instead of ``Union[x, y]``

* Mobjects have the typehint ``Mobject``, e.g.:

.. code:: py

    def match_color(self, mobject: "Mobject"):
        """Match the color with the color of another :class:`~.Mobject`."""
        return self.set_color(mobject.get_color())

* Always parametrize generics (``list[int]`` instead of ``list``,
  ``type[Any]`` instead of ``type``, etc.). This also applies to callables.

.. code:: py

    rate_func: Callable[[float], float] = lambda t: smooth(1 - t)

* Use ``TypeVar`` when you want to "link" type hints as being the same type.
  Consider ``Mobject.copy``, which returns a new instance of the same class.
  It would be type-hinted as:

.. code:: py

    T = TypeVar("T")


    def copy(self: T) -> T:
        ...

* Use ``typing.Iterable`` whenever the function works with *any* iterable, not a specific type.

* If the function returns a container of a specific length each time, consider using ``tuple`` instead of ``list``.

.. code:: py

   def foo() -> tuple[float, float, float]:
       return (0, 0, 0)

* If a function works with a parameter as long as said parameter has a ``__getitem__``, ``__iter___`` and ``__len__`` method,
  the typehint of the parameter should be ``collections.abc.Mapping``. If it also supports ``__setitem__`` and/or ``__delitem__``, it
  should be marked as ``collections.abc.MutableMapping``.

* Typehinting something as ``object`` means that only attributes available on every Python object should be accessed,
  like ``__str__`` and so on. On the other hand, literally any attribute can be accessed on a variable with the ``Any`` typehint -
  it's more freeing than the ``object`` typehint, and makes mypy stop typechecking the variable. Note that whenever possible,
  try to keep typehints as specific as possible.

* If objects are imported purely for type hint purposes, keep it under an ``if typing.TYPE_CHECKING`` guard, to prevent them from
  being imported at runtime (helps library performance). Do not forget to use the ``from __future__ import annotations`` import to avoid having runtime ``NameError`` exceptions.

.. code:: py

   from typing import TYPE_CHECKING

   if TYPE_CHECKING:
       from manim.typing import Vector3
   # type stuff with Vector3
