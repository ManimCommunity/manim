If you want to add a new language, you can go to
`the project page <https://www.transifex.com/manim-community/manim-community-documentation>`_
If you didn't joined the project yet, you will have a link which reads
`Request language`, and send the request.
If you are already in the project, go to the languages page and you have a
blue button reading `Request language` and do your request.

We will have to manually accept the new language, so you will not be able to
translate instantaneously (for new languages).
