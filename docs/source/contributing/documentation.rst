====================
Adding Documentation
====================

When submitting a new class through a PR, or any changes in general,
there should be documentation where possible. Here are our guidelines
for writing documentation.

Guidelines for examples
-----------------------

Everybody is welcome to contribute examples to the documentation. Since straightforward examples are a great resource for quickly learning manim, here are some guidelines.

What makes a great example
--------------------------

.. note:: 

   As soon as a new version of manim is released, the documentation will be a snapshot of that version. Examples contributed after the release will only be shown in the latest documentation.
   
* Examples should be ready to copy and paste for use.

* Examples should be brief yet still easy to understand.

* Examples don't require the ``from manim import *`` statement, this will be added automatically when the docs are built.

* There should be a balance of animated and non-animated examples.

- As manim makes animations, we can include lots of animated examples; however, our RTD has a maximum 15 minutes to build. Animated examples should only be used when necessary, as last frame examples render faster.

- Lots of examples (e.g. size of a plot-axis, setting opacities, making texts, etc.) will also work as images. It is a lot more convenient to see the end product immediately instead of waiting for an animation to reveal it.

* Please ensure the examples run on the current master when you contribute an example.

How examples are structured
---------------------------

* Examples can be organized into chapters and subchapters.

- When you create examples, the beginning example chapter should focus on only one functionality. When the functionality is simple, multiple ideas can be illustrated under a single example.

- As soon as simple functionalities are explained, the chapter may include more complex examples which build on the simpler ideas.

Writing examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you want to add/edit examples, they can be found in the ``docs/source/`` directory, or directly in the manim source code (e.g. ``manim/mobject/mobject.py``). The examples are written in 
``rst`` format and use the manim directive (see :mod:`~.manim_directive` ), ``.. manim::``. Every example is in its own block, and looks like this:

.. code:: rst

    Formulas
    ========

    .. manim:: Formula1
        :save_last_frame:

        class Formula1(Scene):
            def construct(self):
                t = MathTex(r"\int_a^b f'(x) dx = f(b) - f(a)")
                self.add(t)
                self.wait(1)

In the building process of the docs, all ``rst`` files are scanned, and the 
manim directive (``.. manim::``) blocks are identified as scenes that will be run 
by the current version of manim.
Here is the syntax:

* ``.. manim:: [SCENE_NAME]`` has no indentation and ``SCENE_NAME`` refers to the name of the class below.

* The flags are followed in the next line (no blank line here!), with the indention level of one tab.

All possible flags can be found at :mod:`~.manim_directive`.

In the example above, the ``Formula1`` following ``.. manim::`` is the scene
that the directive expects to render; thus, in the python code, the class
has the same name: ``class Formula1(Scene)``.

.. note::

   Sometimes, when you reload an example in your browser, it has still the old
   website somewhere in its cache. If this is the case, delete the website cache,
   or open a new incognito tab in your browser, then the latest docs
   should be shown. 
   **Only for locally built documentation:** If this still doesn't work, you may need
   to delete the contents of ``docs/source/references`` before rebuilding
   the documentation.

Formatting and Running Tests
----------------------------

Please begin the description of the class/function in the same line as
the 3 quotes:

.. code:: py

    def do_this():
        """This is correct.
        (...)
        """


    def dont_do_this():
        """
        This is incorrect.
        (...)
        """

NumPy Format
------------

Use the numpy format for sections and formatting - see
https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html.

This includes:

1. The usage of ``Attributes`` to specify ALL ATTRIBUTES that a
   class can have, their respective types, and a brief (or long, if
   needed) description. (See more on :ref:`_types`)

Also, ``__init__`` parameters should be specified as ``Parameters`` **on
the class docstring**, *rather than under* ``__init__``. Note that this
can be omitted if the parameters and the attributes are the same
(i.e., dataclass) - priority should be given to the ``Attributes``
section, in this case, which must **always be present**, unless the
class specifies no attributes at all. (See more on Parameters in number
2 of this list.)

Example:

.. code:: py

    class MyClass:
        """My cool class. Long or short (whatever is more appropriate) description here.

        Parameters
        ----------
        name : :class:`str`
            The class's name.
        id : :class:`int`
            The class's id.
        mobj : Optional[:class:`~.Mobject`], optional
            The mobject linked to this instance. Defaults to `Mobject()` \
    (is set to that if `None` is specified).

        Attributes
        ----------
        name : :class:`str`
            The user's name.
        id : :class:`int`
            The user's id.
        singleton : :class:`MyClass`
            Something.
        mobj : :class:`~.Mobject`
            The mobject linked to this instance.
        """

        def __init__(
            name, id, singleton, mobj=None
        ):  # in-code typehints are optional for now
            ...

2. The usage of ``Parameters`` on functions to specify how
   every parameter works and what it does. This should be excluded if
   the function has no parameters. Note that you **should not** specify
   the default value of the parameter on the type. On the documentation
   render, this is already specified on the function's signature. If you
   need to indicate a further consequence of value omission or simply
   want to specify it on the docs, make sure to **specify it in the
   parameter's DESCRIPTION**.

See an example on list item 4.

.. note::

   When documenting varargs (args and kwargs), make sure to
   document them by listing the possible types of each value specified,
   like this:

::

    Parameters
    ----------
    args : Union[:class:`int`, :class:`float`]
      The args specified can be either an int or a float.
    kwargs : :class:`float`
      The kwargs specified can only be a float.

Note that, if the kwargs expect specific values, those can be specified
in a section such as ``Other Parameters``:

::

    Other Parameters
    ----------------
    kwarg_param_1 : :class:`int`
      Parameter documentation here
    (etc)

3. The usage of ``Returns`` to indicate what is the type of this
   function's return value and what exactly it returns (i.e., a brief -
   or long, if needed - description of what this function returns). Can
   be omitted if the function does not explicitly return (i.e., always
   returns ``None`` because ``return`` is never specified, and it is
   very clear why this function does not return at all). In all other
   cases, it should be specified.

See an example on list item 4.

4. The usage of ``Examples`` in order to specify an example of usage of
   a function **is highly encouraged** and, in general, should be
   specified for *every function* unless its usage is **extremely
   obvious**, which can be debatable. Even if it is, it's always a good
   idea to add an example in order to give a better orientation to the
   documentation user. Use the following format for Python code:

   .. code:: rst

       ::

       # python code here

.. note::
   Also, if this is a video- or animation-related change, please
   try to add an example GIF or video if possible for demonstration
   purposes.

Make sure to be as explicit as possible in your documentation. We all
want the users to have an easier time using this library.

Example:

.. code:: py

    def my_function(thing, other, name, *, d, test=45):  # typings are optional for now
        """My cool function. Builds and modifies an :class:`EpicClassInThisFile` instance with the given 
        parameters.

      Parameters
      ----------
      thing : :class:`int`
          Specifies the index of life.
      other : :class:`numpy.ndarray`
          Specifies something cool.
      name : :class:`str`
          Specifies my name.
      d : :class:`~.SomeClassFromFarAway`
          Sets thing D to this value.
      test : :class:`int`, optional
          Defines the amount of times things should be tested. \
    Defaults to 45, because that is almost the meaning of life.

      Returns
      -------
      :class:`EpicClassInThisFile`
          The generated EpicClass with the specified attributes and modifications.

      Examples
      --------
      Normal usage::

          my_function(5, np.array([1, 2, 3]), "Chelovek", d=SomeClassFromFarAway(cool=True), test=5)
      """
        # code...
        pass

.. _types:

Reference to types in documentaion
----------------------------------

Always specify types with the correct **role** (see
https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/1.7/domains.html#python-roles) for the
sake of proper rendering. E.g.: Use ``:class:`int``` to refer to an int
type, and in general ``:class:`<path>`​`` to refer to a certain class
(see ``Path specification`` below). See after for more specific
instructions.

Path specifications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. If it's on stdlib: Use ``<name>`` directly. If it's a class, just the
   name is enough. If it's a method (``:meth:``) or attribute
   (``:attr:``), dotted names may be used (e.g.
   ``:meth:`str.to_lower`​``).

Example: ``:class:`int`​``, ``:class:`str`​``, ``:class:`float`​``,
``:class:`bool`​``

2. If it's on the same file as the docstring or, for methods and
   attributes, under the same class, then the name may also be specified
   directly.

Example: ``:class:`MyClass`​`` referring to a class in the same file;
``:meth:`push`​`` referring to a method in the same class;
``:meth:`MyClass.push`​`` referring to a method in a different class in
the same file; ``:attr:`color`​`` referring to an attribute in the same
class; ``:attr:`MyClass.color`​`` referring to an attribute in a
different class in the same file.

3. If it's on a different file, then you may either use the full dotted
   name (e.g. ``~manim.animations.Animation``) or simply use the
   shortened way (``~.Animation``). Note that, if there is ambiguity,
   then the full dotted name must be used where the actual class can't
   be deduced. Also, note the ``~`` before the path - this is so that it
   displays just ``Animation`` instead of the full location in the
   rendering. It can be removed for disambiguation purposes only.

Example: ``:class:`~.Animation`​``, ``:meth:`~.VMobject.set_color`​``,
``:attr:`~.VMobject.color`​``

4. If it's a class from a different module, specify the full dotted
   syntax.

Example: ``:class:`numpy.ndarray`​`` for a numpy ndarray.

Reference type specifications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**The following instructions refer to types of attributes, parameters,
and return values.** When specifying a type mid-text, it does not
necessarily have to be typeset. However, if it's a class name, a method,
or an enum's attribute/variant, then it is recommended to be typeset at
least on the first occurrence of the name so that the users can quickly
jump to the related documentation.

1. Class names should be wrapped in ``:class:`path_goes_here`​``. See
   examples in the subsection above.
2. Method names should be wrapped in ``:meth:`path_goes_here`​``. See
   examples in the subsection above.
3. Attribute names should be wrapped in ``:attr:`path_goes_here`​``. See
   examples in the subsection above.
4. If ``None`` can also be specified, use ``Optional[type]``, where
   ``type`` must follow the guidelines in the current section.

Example: ``Optional[:class:`str`]`` means you can either specify a
``str`` or ``None``.

5. If more than one type is possible, use
   ``Union[type_1, type_2, (...), type_n]``, where all the ``type_n``
   must follow the guidelines in the current section. Note that, if one
   of these types is ``None``, then the Union should be wrapped with
   ``Optional`` instead.

Example: ``Union[:class:`str`, :class:`int`]`` for either ``str`` or
``int``. ``Optional[Union[:class:`int`, :class:`bool`]]`` for either
``int``, ``bool`` or ``None``.

6. **Dictionaries:** Use ``Dict[key_type, value_type]``, where
   ``key_type`` and ``value_type`` must follow the guidelines in the
   current section.

Example: ``Dict[:class:`str`, :class:`~.Mobject`]`` is a dictionary that
maps strings to Mobjects.
``Dict[:class:`str`, Union[:class:`int`, :class:`MyClass`]]`` is a
dictionary that maps a string to either an int or an instance of
``MyClass``.

7. **If the parameter is a list:** Note that it is very rare to require
   the parameter to be exactly a ``list`` type. One could usually
   specify a ``tuple`` instead, for example. So, in order to cover all
   cases, consider:

   1. If the parameter only needs to be an ``Iterable``, i.e., if the
      function only requires being able to iterate over this parameter's
      value (e.g. can be a ``list``, ``tuple``, ``str``, but also
      ``zip()``, ``iter()`` and so on), then specify
      ``Iterable[type_here]``, where ``type_here`` is the type of the
      iterable's yielded elements and should follow the format in the
      present section (``Type specifications``).

   Example: ``Iterable[:class:`str`]`` for any iterable of strings;
   ``Iterable[:class:`~.Mobject`]`` for an iterable of Mobjects; etc.

   2. If you require being able to index the parameter (i.e. ``x[n]``)
      or retrieve its length (i.e. ``len(x)``), or even just pass it to
      a function that requires any of those, then specify ``Sequence``,
      which allows any list-like object to be specified (e.g. ``list``,
      ``tuple``...)

   Example: ``Sequence[:class:`str`]`` for a sequence of strings;
   ``Sequence[Union[:class:`str`, :class:`int`]]`` for a sequence of
   integers or strings.

   3. If you EXPLICITLY REQUIRE it to be a ``list`` for some reason,
      then use ``List[type]``, where ``type`` is the type that any
      element in the list will have. It must follow the guidelines in
      the current section.

8. **If the return type is a list or tuple:** Specify ``List[type]`` for
   a list, ``Tuple[type_a, type_b, (...), type_n]`` for a tuple (if the
   elements are all different) or ``Tuple[type, ...]`` (if all elements
   have the same type). Each ``type_n`` on those representations
   corresponds to elements in the returned list/tuple and must follow
   the guidelines in the current section.

Example: ``List[Optional[:class:`str`]]`` for a list that returns
elements that are either a ``str`` or ``None``;
``Tuple[:class:`str`, :class:`int`]`` for a tuple of type
``(str, int)``; ``Tuple[:class:`int`, ...]`` for a tuple of variable
length with only integers.


Adding type hints to functions and parameters
---------------------------------------------

.. warning::
   This section is still a work in progress.

If you've never used type hints before, this is a good place to get started:
https://realpython.com/python-type-checking/#hello-types.

When adding type hints to manim, there are some guidelines that should be followed:

* Coordinates have the typehint ``Sequence[float]``, e.g.

.. code:: py

    def set_points_as_corners(self, points: Sequence[float]) -> "VMobject":
        """Given an array of points, set them as corner of the Vmobject."""

* ``**kwargs`` has no typehint

* Mobjects have the typehint "Mobject", e.g.

.. code:: py

    def match_color(self, mobject: "Mobject"):
        """Match the color with the color of another :class:`~.Mobject`."""
        return self.set_color(mobject.get_color())

* Colors have the typehint ``Color``, e.g.

.. code:: py

    def set_color(self, color: Color = YELLOW_C, family: bool = True):
        """Condition is function which takes in one arguments, (x, y, z)."""

* As ``float`` and ``Union[int, float]`` are the same, use only ``float``

* For numpy arrays use the typehint ``np.ndarray``

* Functions that does not return a value should get the type hint ``None``. (This annotations help catch the kinds of subtle bugs where you are trying to use a meaningless return value. )

.. code:: py

    def height(self, value) -> None:
        self.scale_to_fit_height(value)

* Parameters that are None by default should get the type hint ``Optional``

.. code:: py

    def rotate(
        self,
        angle,
        axis=OUT,
        about_point: Optional[Sequence[float]] = None,
        **kwargs,
    ):
        pass


* the .__init__() method always should have None as its return type.

* functions and lambda functions should get the typehint ``Callable``

.. code:: py

    rate_func: Callable[[float], float] = lambda t: smooth(1 - t)

*  numpy arrays can get type hints with ``np.ndarray``

* assuming that typical path objects are either Paths or strs, one can use the typehint ``typing.Union[str, pathlib.Path]``



Adding Blocks for Tip, Note, Important etc. (Admonitions)
---------------------------------------------------------

The following directives are called Admonitions. You
can use them to point out additional or important
information. Here are some examples:
