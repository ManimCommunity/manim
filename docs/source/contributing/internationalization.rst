Internationalization

If you want to help with translating the docs:


#. You will first have to create an account. Go to `this page <https://accounts.crowdin.com/register?domain=manim>` and fill up your informations. You can also log in using one of the proposed websites.
#. You should have received a confirmation email. It is not mandatory to verify you email address, but we advise you to do so, in case you lose your password or anything.
#. Go to `https://translate.manim.community/ <https://translate.manim.community/>`
#. Click the `translate` button on the manim project.
#. Select the language you want to help with by clicking on it.
#. Then you can either click on any file to help translating it, or you can click on *Translate all* to help with translating any file.
#. If it is your first time translating on *Crowdin*, you should have some tutorial slides explaining how to translate using their interface.
#. Now you can translate ! The source text appears above a text field that you can fill. Below, you have automatic translations that can be used as a basis.

Thanks a lot for helping Manim with getting broader !

You can also upvote or downvote translations given by other. To that extend, go to the translation editor for any language (like you did to translate). When you click on an already translated string, You can see translations that have been proposed below it (between the translation input text field and the machine translation) and there you can upvote or downvote the translation.

.. note::
	This is disabled for some languages for which we use trusted reviewers. For now, these languages are *Chinese Simplified*, *Chinese Traditional*, *French*, *Hindi* , and *Spanish*.

If you want to become a reviewer, please join `Manim's Discord server <https://www.manim.community/discord/>`_
and ping the role @Translation Admin. We will then study your case.

We can't add new languages as we are limited by ReadTheDocs available languages. If you want to complain, go to them ^^.
