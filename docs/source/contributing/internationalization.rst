.. note::
   The translation process is currently not yet ready. Please avoid translating pages for now.

If you want to help with translating the docs:

#. Make sure you have a `Transifex <https://www.transifex.com/>`_ account. Transifex is a tool for colaborative translation and allows the Manim team to review translations.
#. Open the `Manim Transifex project page <https://www.transifex.com/manim-community/manim-community-documentation>`_ .
#. Click on ``Join Team``.
#. Select the language you want to help with.

Congratulations! You are now a Translator for the Manim project!


You'll see the projects you've joined just on the left of your profile picture
on the top bar.

Now go to the
`languages list <https://www.transifex.com/manim-community/manim-community-documentation/languages/>`_
and select a language you want to help with. You should see a blue button reading
`Translate`; click on it to get started! You will see a list of
resources in the project. You can click on any untranslated resource, then
click on `Translate`. You will then see something like the following:

The `A` panel is the list of all the strings in the resource. Click on any of
them to translate it. It will appear in the `B` panel, and you will be able to
work on your translation in the `C` panel. Once you're done, click `Save changes`.
Your translation will have to be reviewed before being added to the docs.
You can also get back to the resources list by clicking `d` or change the
destination language in `e`.


If you want to become a reviewer, please join `Manim's Discord server <https://www.manim.community/discord/>`_
and ping the role @Translation Admin.

If you want to add a new language, you can go to
`the project page <https://www.transifex.com/manim-community/manim-community-documentation>`_
If you haven't joined the project yet, you will have a link which reads
`Request language` which you can click.
If you are already in the project, this button will be in the languages page.

We will have to manually accept the new language, so you will not be able to
translate instantaneously (for new languages).
