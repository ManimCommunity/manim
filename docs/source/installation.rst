Installing Manim
****************

Manim-Community runs on Python 3.6+. If you'd like to just use the library, you
can install it from PyPI via pip:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install manim

You can replace ``pip`` with ``pip3`` if you need to in your system.

Alternatively, you can work with Manim using our Docker image that can be
found at `Docker Hub <https://hub.docker.com/r/manimcommunity/manim>`_.

If you'd like to contribute to and/or help develop ``manim-community``, you can
clone this repository to your local device.  To do this, first make sure you
have ``git`` installed. Then, clone this repo by executing either

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone git@github.com:ManimCommunity/manim.git

or

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim.git

depending on whether you want to use HTTPS or SSH.  Finally, after having
cloned this repo, run the following:

.. code-block:: bash

   python3 -m pip install .

Please see :doc:`contributing` for more details about contributing to Manim.

.. warning::

   If you want to contribute to ``manim-community`` and have cloned the
   repository to your local device, please uninstall the pip-installed version
   of ``manim-community``, if you had installed it previously.
   This is to avoid any accidental usage of the pip-installed version when developing
   and testing on your local copy of the repository. This warning doesn't apply for
   users who use `poetry <https://python-poetry.org>`_.
