Installation
============

Manim has a few dependencies that need to be installed before it.  The
following pages have instructions that are specific to your system.  Once you
are done installing the dependencies, come back to this page to install manim

Installing Manim
****************

Manim-Community runs on Python 3.6+. If you'd like to just use the library, you
can install it from PyPI via pip:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install manim

You can replace ``pip`` with ``pip3`` if you need to in your system.

Alternatively, you can work with Manim using our Docker image that can be
found at `Docker Hub <https://hub.docker.com/r/manimcommunity/manim>`_.
