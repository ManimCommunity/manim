Contributing can be confusing, so here are a few guides:

#. By default, the documentation for methods of a class is autogenerated in alphabetical
   order.  However, for classes with many methods, this is sup-optimal.  When
   documenting classes with many methods, please consider doing the following.  Modify
   the ``manim/docs/source/custom_method_order.py`` file by adding a new key to the
   ``custom_method_order`` dictionary.  The key should be the name of the class you are
   documenting.  The value is a second dictionary.  This second dictionary has items of
   the form (section_title: method_list).  This will force the autogenerated
   documentation for the methods to be broken down into sections.  An example can be
   seen here: :ref:`reference/manim.mobject.mobject.Mobject`.



**Thank you for contributing!**
