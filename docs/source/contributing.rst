.. important:: Manim is currently undergoing a major refactor. In general,
   contributions implementing new features will not be accepted in this period.
   Other contributions unrelated to cleaning up the codebase may also take a longer
   period of time to be reviewed. This guide may quickly become outdated quickly; we
   highly recommend joining our `Discord server <https://www.manim.community/discord/>`__
   to discuss any potential contributions and keep up to date with the latest developments.
